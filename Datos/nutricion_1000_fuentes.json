Here, we analyze aging and nutrition studies in simple organisms, rodents, monkeys, and humans to link longevity to conserved growth and metabolic pathways and outline their role in aging and age-related disease. We focus on feasible nutritional strategies shown to delay aging and/or prevent diseases through epidemiological, model organism, clinical, and centenarian studies and underline the need to avoid malnourishment and frailty. These findings are integrated to define a longevity diet based on a multi-pillar approach adjusted for age and health status to optimize lifespan and healthspan in humans."

Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored<sup>2-8</sup>. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity<sup>9</sup>. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling-an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity. Our findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and raise questions about which end points are the most relevant for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials."

            "abstract": "Healthy aging and human longevity are intricate phenotypes affected by environmental factors such as physical exercise, diet, health habits, and psychosocial situations as well as genetic factors. Diet and caloric restriction have a crucial role in healthy aging. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound isolated from the Curcuma longa, has been shown to exert anti-aging characteristics. Recently, investigations on curcumin with regard to aging and age-associated disease in model organisms has described that curcumin and its metabolites, prolong the mean lifespan of some aging model organisms such as C. elegans, D. melanogaster, yeast, and mouse. It has been proposed to have several biological activities, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, chemopreventive, and anti-neurodegenerative characteristics. In several studies on various model organisms it has been shown that the lifespan extension via curcumin treatment was connected with enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and also declined malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin levels. As well as the pivotal role of curcumin on the modulating of major signaling pathways that influence longevity of organisms like IIS, mTOR, PKA, and FOXO signaling pathways. This review defines the use of curcumin in traditional and modern medicine, its biochemistry and biological functions, such as curcumin's anti-aging, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant characteristics. Also, the review further describes the role of curcumin in a pharmacological context and new insights on its therapeutic capacity and restrictions. Particularly, the review emphasizes in-depth on the efficiency of curcumin and its mechanism of action as an anti-aging compound and also treating age-related disease."

Under CR, mice self-impose chronic cycles of 2-hour feeding and 22-hour fasting, raising the question of if it is calories, fasting, or time of day that is the cause of this increased life span. We show here that 30% CR was sufficient to extend the life span by 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian alignment of feeding acted together to extend life span by 35% in male C57BL/6J mice. These effects were independent of body weight. Aging induced widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in the expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad libitum-fed mice. CR at night ameliorated these aging-related changes. Our results show that circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging."

Testosterone levels have also been studied in relation to the impact of diseases, aging, nutrition and the environment on its circulating levels. Conversely, the impact of testosterone on health has also been evaluated with respect to its cardiac and vascular protective effects, body composition, autoimmunity and all-cause mortality. The male aging process results in decreasing testosterone levels over time. The exact mechanisms and impact of these changes in testosterone levels with age on health- and life-span are still not completely clear.

The natural polyamine spermidine has been similarly linked to autophagy enhancement, geroprotection and reduced incidence of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases across species borders. Here, we asked whether the cellular and physiological consequences of caloric restriction and fasting depend on polyamine metabolism. We report that spermidine levels increased upon distinct regimens of fasting or caloric restriction in yeast, flies, mice and human volunteers. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of endogenous spermidine synthesis reduced fasting-induced autophagy in yeast, nematodes and human cells. Furthermore, perturbing the polyamine pathway in vivo abrogated the lifespan- and healthspan-extending effects, as well as the cardioprotective and anti-arthritic consequences of fasting. Mechanistically, spermidine mediated these effects via autophagy induction and hypusination of the translation regulator eIF5A. In summary, the polyamine-hypusination axis emerges as a phylogenetically conserved metabolic control hub for fasting-mediated autophagy enhancement and longevity."

From these, nutrition is a key component affecting our health, and several studies particularly in model organisms and rodents have shown that nutrition has also the potential to increase lifespan. This review, therefore, aimed to summarize and discuss the most important nutritional components and diets which have been repeatedly associated with longevity. A brief summary of mechanistic factors involved, like for example mTor, IGF-1, and autophagy, will also be presented. Finally, the association of foods and diets with all-cause mortality will be summarized by conducting a mini umbrella review of available meta-analyses. The main conclusions of this review are that caloric restriction without malnutrition, methionine restriction, lower protein intake or supplementation of spermidine are major life-extending factors, in model organisms or rodents. In humans, certain healthy foods are associated with longer telomere length, and reductions in protein intake with lower IGF-1 levels, respectively, both relations being associated with longer lifespan. Furthermore, a high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and also coffee is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality whereas a high intake of (red) meat and especially processed meat is positively related to all-cause mortality. In addition, the Mediterranean and also high-quality diets are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk."

Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, the Mediterranean diet, as well as the ketogenic diet showed promising effects on promoting healthy aging, possibly by modulating mTORC1 AMPK, an insulin signaling pathway. By understanding the intricate interplay between diet and molecular pathways, we can develop personalized dietary strategies that not only prevent age-related diseases, but also promote overall health and well-being throughout the aging process."

            "abstract": "Although chronological age correlates with various age-related diseases and conditions, it does not adequately reflect an individual's functional capacity, well-being, or mortality risk. In contrast, biological age provides information about overall health and indicates how rapidly or slowly a person is aging. Estimates of biological age are thought to be provided by aging clocks, which are computational models (e.g., elastic net) that use a set of inputs (e.g., DNA methylation sites) to make a prediction. In the past decade, aging clock studies have shown that several age-related diseases, social variables, and mental health conditions associate with an increase in predicted biological age relative to chronological age. This phenomenon of age acceleration is linked to a higher risk of premature mortality. More recent research has demonstrated that predicted biological age is sensitive to specific interventions. Human trials have reported that caloric restriction, a plant-based diet, lifestyle changes involving exercise, a drug regime including metformin, and vitamin D3 supplementation are all capable of slowing down or reversing an aging clock. Non-interventional studies have connected high-quality sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, and other factors to age deceleration. Specific molecules have been associated with the reduction or reversal of predicted biological age, such as the antihypertensive drug doxazosin or the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate. Although rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate these initial findings, existing data suggest that aging clocks are malleable in humans. Additional research is warranted to better understand these computational models and the clinical significance of lowering or reversing their outputs."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The incidence of stroke, heart failure, dementia, many cancers, coronary artery disease, and physical disability rise exponentially with age. Geroscience is a relatively new discipline that aims to define and modify aging-related biologic pathways, slow age-related disability, prevent age-related diseases, and increase disability-free survival. OBSERVATIONS: Medical therapies typically alter biologic pathways to treat or prevent specific diseases. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholesterol-lowering medications used to prevent development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, disease-focused treatments do not alter aging's effects on disease and declining function (eg, statins do not significantly reduce noncardiovascular mortality or cancer). In animal models, treatments can alter aging's effect on disease. For example, in mice, caloric restriction increases mean lifespan from 10% to 40% compared with mice fed ad libitum and favorably affects multiple cellular pathways implicated in aging including nutrient sensing, protein synthesis, autophagy, and inflammation. In adults with obesity and diabetes, compared with non-caloric restriction intervention groups, randomization to receive caloric restriction was associated with a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality and a lower incidence of weight-related chronic diseases. Rapamycin, a drug approved to suppress posttransplant organ rejection, increased mouse median lifespan by 249 days in females and 154 days in males. A rapamycin analogue, everolimus, improved antibody titers to influenza vaccine in older adults. In humans, senescent cells increase in abundance with age and are characterized by growth arrest, apoptosis resistance, and an altered secretome (the set of proteins secreted by a cell into the extracellular space). A greater abundance of senescent cells is associated with more physical impairments and increased mortality. Reducing the number of these cells in animal models extends lifespan and improves physical function, such as grip strength and mobility, and cardiac ejection fraction. However, potential health benefits of reducing senescent cells in humans remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Therapies that inhibit aging biology, such as caloric restriction, metformin, senolytics, or rapalogs, may slow the development and progression of disease and functional decline in humans."

            "abstract": "In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF) and its numerous modifications have been increasingly suggested as a promising therapy for age-related problems and a non-pharmacological strategy to extend lifespan. Despite the great variability in feeding schedules that we describe in the current work, underlying physiological processes are the same and include a periodic switch from glucose metabolism (generated by glycogenolysis) to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones. Many of the beneficial effects of IF appear to be mediated by optimization of energy utilization. Findings to date from both human and animal experiments indicate that fasting improves physiological function, enhances performance, and slows aging and disease processes. In this review, we discuss some of the remarkable discoveries about the beneficial effects of IF on metabolism, endocrine and cardiovascular systems, cancer prevention, brain health, neurodegeneration and aging. Experimental studies on rodent models and human investigations are summarized to compare the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of IF. Metabolic and cellular responses triggered by IF could help to achieve the aim of preventing disease, and maximizing healthspan and longevity with minimal side effects."

            "abstract": "The main objective of this review is to provide an appraisal of the current status of the relationship between energy intake and the life span of animals. The concept that a reduction in food intake, or caloric restriction (CR), retards the aging process, delays the age-associated decline in physiological fitness, and extends the life span of organisms of diverse phylogenetic groups is one of the leading paradigms in gerontology. However, emerging evidence disputes some of the primary tenets of this conception. One disparity is that the CR-related increase in longevity is not universal and may not even be shared among different strains of the same species. A further misgiving is that the control animals, fed ad libitum (AL), become overweight and prone to early onset of diseases and death, and thus may not be the ideal control animals for studies concerned with comparisons of longevity. Reexamination of body weight and longevity data from a study involving over 60,000 mice and rats, conducted by a National Institute on Aging-sponsored project, suggests that CR-related increase in life span of specific genotypes is directly related to the gain in body weight under the AL feeding regimen. Additionally, CR in mammals and \"dietary restriction\" in organisms such as Drosophila are dissimilar phenomena, albeit they are often presented to be the very same. The latter involves a reduction in yeast rather than caloric intake, which is inconsistent with the notion of a common, conserved mechanism of CR action in different species. Although specific mechanisms by which CR affects longevity are not well understood, existing evidence supports the view that CR increases the life span of those particular genotypes that develop energy imbalance owing to AL feeding. In such groups, CR lowers body temperature, rate of metabolism, and oxidant production and retards the age-related pro-oxidizing shift in the redox state."

This evaluation was framed within the context of hormesis, a biphasic dose response with specific quantitative features describing the limits of biological/phenotypic plasticity for integrative biological endpoints (e.g., cell proliferation, memory, fecundity, growth, tissue repair, stem cell population expansion/differentiation, longevity). Evaluation of several hundred lifespan extending agents using yeast, nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), multiple insect and other invertebrate and vertebrate models (e.g., fish, rodents), revealed they responded in a manner [average (mean/median) and maximum lifespans] consistent with the quantitative features [i.e., 30-60% greater at maximum (Hormesis Rule)] of the hormetic dose response. These lifespan extension features were independent of biological model, inducing agent, endpoints measured and mechanism. These findings indicate that hormesis describes the capacity to extend life via numerous agents and activities and that the magnitude of lifespan extension is modest, in the percentage, not fold, range. These findings have important implications for human aging, genetic diseases/environmental stresses and lifespan extension, as well as public health practices and long-term societal resource planning."

In 53 (34 CR and 19 control) non-obese adults, we tested the hypothesis that energy expenditure (EE) and its endocrine mediators are reduced with a CR diet over 2 years. Approximately 15% CR was achieved over 2 years, resulting in an average 8.7 kg weight loss, whereas controls gained 1.8 kg. In the CR group, EE measured over 24 hr or during sleep was approximately 80-120 kcal/day lower than expected on the basis of weight loss, indicating sustained metabolic adaptation over 2 years. This metabolic adaptation was accompanied by significantly reduced thyroid axis activity and reactive oxygen species (F2-isoprostane) production. Findings from this 2-year CR trial in healthy, non-obese humans provide new evidence of persistent metabolic slowing accompanied by reduced oxidative stress, which supports the rate of living and oxidative damage theories of mammalian aging."

Here, we directly compare in mice the two diets used in the primate studies focusing on three paradigms: ad libitum (AL), 30% calorie restriction (CR), and single-meal feeding (MF), which accounts for differences in energy density and caloric intake consumed by the AL mice. MF and CR regimes enhanced longevity regardless of diet composition, which alone had no significant impact within feeding regimens. Like CR animals, MF mice ate quickly, imposing periods of extended daily fasting on themselves that produced significant improvements in morbidity and mortality compared with AL. These health and survival benefits conferred by periods of extended daily fasting, independent of dietary composition, have major implications for human health and clinical applicability."

Here we introduce an adapted Pace of Aging method designed to quantify differences between individuals and populations in the speed of aging-related health declines. The adapted Pace of Aging method, implemented in parallel in data from the US Health and Retirement Study and in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (combined n = 19,045), integrates longitudinal data on blood biomarkers, physical measurements and functional tests. It reveals stark differences in rates of aging between population subgroups and demonstrates strong and consistent prospective associations with incident morbidity, disability and mortality. This adapted and generalizable method to measure Pace of Aging can advance the population science of healthy longevity."

Because macroautophagy/autophagy is regarded as one of the major determinants of cellular fitness in vitro and in vivo, maneuvers that aim at promoting autophagy may slow down aging and promote health span. Caloric restriction (CR), a reduction in caloric intake without malnutrition, efficiently counteracts aging-associated features, yet is difficult to be applied to humans. Caloric-restriction mimetics (CRMs) are pharmacological agents that recapitulate the main biochemical properties of CR, namely a global reduction of protein acetylation and the induction of autophagy. We found that the ancient drug aspirin and its active metabolite salicylate stimulate autophagic flux by virtue of their inhibitory action on acetyltransferase EP300. The inhibition of EP300 results from a direct competition between salicylate and acetyl coenzyme A for binding to the catalytic domain of the enzyme. This mode of action appears to be conserved across evolution as it accounts for the induction of autophagy by aspirin in various mouse models and in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. In sum, aspirin acts as a CRM."

Free radicals have been implicated in aging processes; it is hypothesized that they cause cumulative oxidative damage to crucial macromolecules and are responsible for failure of multiple physiological mechanisms. However, recent investigations have also suggested that free radicals can act as modulators of several signaling pathways such as those related to sirtuins. Caloric restriction is a non-genetic manipulation that extends lifespan of several species and improves healthspan; the belief that many of these benefits are due to the induction of sirtuins has led to the search for sirtuin activators, especially sirtuin 1, the most studied. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red grapes, was first known for its antioxidant and antifungal properties, and subsequently has been reported several biological effects, including the activation of sirtuins. Endogenously-produced melatonin, a powerful free radical scavenger, declines with age and its loss contributes to degenerative conditions of aging. Recently, it was reported that melatonin also activates sirtuins, in addition to other functions, such as regulator of circadian rhythms or anti-inflammatory properties. The fact that melatonin and resveratrol are present in various foods, exhibiting possible synergistic effects, suggests the use of dietary ingredients to promote health and longevity."

Chronic inflammation, accumulation of DNA damage, dysfunctional mitochondria, and increased senescent cell load are factors contributing to this. Mechanistic investigations have revealed specific pathways and processes which, proposedly, cause age-related phenotypes such as frailty, reduced physical resilience, and multi-morbidity. Among promising treatments alleviating the consequences of aging are caloric restriction and pharmacologically targeting longevity pathways such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), sirtuins, and anti-apoptotic pathways in senescent cells. Regulation of these pathways and processes has revealed significant health- and lifespan extending results in animal models. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if similar results translate to humans. A requirement of translation are the development of age- and morbidity associated biomarkers as longitudinal trials are difficult and not feasible, practical, nor ethical when human life span is the endpoint. Current biomarkers and the results of anti-aging intervention studies in humans will be covered within this paper. The future of clinical trials targeting aging may be phase 2 and 3 studies with larger populations if safety and tolerability of investigated medication continues not to be a hurdle for further investigations."

A chronic state of oxidative stress exists in cells because of an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants. The amount of oxidative damage increases as an organism ages and is postulated to be a major causal factor of senescence. Support for this hypothesis includes the following observations: (i) Overexpression of antioxidative enzymes retards the age-related accrual of oxidative damage and extends the maximum life-span of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. (ii) Variations in longevity among different species inversely correlate with the rates of mitochondrial generation of the superoxide anion radical (O2) and hydrogen peroxide. (iii) Restriction of caloric intake lowers steady-state levels of oxidative stress and damage, retards age-associated changes, and extends the maximum life-span in mammals."

Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of aging and determinants of life span will help to reduce age-related morbidity and facilitate healthy aging. Extension of maximal life span is currently possible in animal models with measures such as genetic manipulations and caloric restriction (CR). CR appears to prolong life by reducing oxidative damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to cause deleterious effects on DNA, proteins, and lipids, and generation of these highly reactive molecules takes place in the mitochondria. But ROS is positively implicated in cellular stress defense mechanisms and formation of ROS a highly regulated process controlled by a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. There are endogenous anti-oxidant defense systems that have the potential to partially counteract ROS impact. In this review, we will describe pathways contributing to the regulation of the age-related decline in mitochondrial function and their impact on longevity.

Recent publications describe transgenic and other mutant rodents displaying lifespan extension, and the rapid pace at which these animals are being generated raises the possibility that the importance of the CR paradigm is declining. Here we discuss these models and evaluate the evidence whether or not the aging process is retarded based on longevity, disease patterns and age-associated biological changes. A comparison to rodents on CR is made. Because CR has been investigated for approximately 70 years with increasing intensity, there exists extensive data to document aging retardation. In contrast, for nearly all of the genetically abnormal models of lifespan extension, such data are minimal and often unconvincing; additional studies will be required to validate these strains as suitable models for aging research."

Indeed, aging promotes the structural and functional declines of both the heart and the blood circulation system.

In particular, we evaluate autophagy, the intracellular catabolic recycling system associated with life- and health-span extension. We present genetic models, pharmacological interventions, and dietary strategies that block, reduce, or enhance autophagy upon age-related cardiovascular deterioration. Caloric restriction or caloric restriction mimetics like metformin, spermidine, and rapamycin (all of which trigger autophagy) are among the most promising cardioprotective interventions during aging. We conclude that autophagy is a fundamental process to ensure cardiac and vascular health during aging and outline its putative therapeutic importance."

Specific types of chronic, intermittent, or periodic dietary restrictions without chronic caloric restriction have instead the potential to provide a significant healthspan increase while minimizing adverse effects. Improved periodic or targeted dietary restriction regimens that uncouple the challenge of food deprivation from the beneficial effects will allow a safe intervention feasible for a major portion of the population.

However, autophagy decreases during aging and that can lead to the development of aging-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, etc. It was shown that autophagy can be induced by mechanical or chemical stress. In this regard, various pharmacological compounds were proposed, including natural polyphenols. Apart from the ability to induce autophagy, polyphenols, such as resveratrol, are capable of modulating the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, neutralizing free radical species, affecting mitochondrial functions, chelating redox-active transition metal ions, and preventing protein aggregation. Moreover, polyphenols have advantages compared to chemical inducers of autophagy due to their intrinsic natural bio-compatibility and safety. In this context, polyphenols can be considered as a potential therapeutic tool for healthy aging either as a part of a diet or as separate compounds (supplements). This review discusses the epigenetic aspect and the underlying molecular mechanism of polyphenols as an anti-aging remedy. In addition, the recent advances of studies on NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) regulation of autophagy, the role of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cells senescence and their regulation by polyphenols have been highlighted as well. Apart from that, the review also revised the latest information on how polyphenols can help to improve mitochondrial function and modulate apoptosis (programmed cell death)."

In this review, we summarize emerging discoveries that point to TFEB activity affecting the hallmarks of aging, including inhibiting DNA damage and epigenetic modifications, inducing autophagy and cell clearance to promote proteostasis, regulating mitochondrial quality control, linking nutrient-sensing to energy metabolism, regulating pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, inhibiting senescence and promoting cell regenerative capacity. Furthermore, the therapeutic impact of TFEB activation on normal aging and tissue-specific disease development is assessed in the contexts of neurodegeneration and neuroplasticity, stem cell differentiation, immune responses, muscle energy adaptation, adipose tissue browning, hepatic functions, bone remodeling, and cancer. Safe and effective strategies of activating TFEB hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for multiple age-associated diseases and for extending lifespan."

Regarding the essential function of autophagy for preserving cellular homeostasis, changes in, or dysfunction of, autophagy flux can lead to disease development. In the current paper, the complicated function of autophagy in aging-associated pathologies and cancer is evaluated, highlighting the underlying molecular mechanisms that can affect longevity and disease pathogenesis. As a natural biological process, a reduction in autophagy is observed with aging, resulting in an accumulation of cell damage and the development of different diseases, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The MTOR, AMPK, and ATG proteins demonstrate changes during aging, and they are promising therapeutic targets. Insulin/IGF1, TOR, PKA, AKT/PKB, caloric restriction and mitochondrial respiration are vital for lifespan regulation and can modulate or have an interaction with autophagy. The specific types of autophagy, such as mitophagy that degrades mitochondria, can regulate aging by affecting these organelles and eliminating those mitochondria with genomic mutations. Autophagy and its specific types contribute to the regulation of carcinogenesis and they are able to dually enhance or decrease cancer progression. Cancer hallmarks, including proliferation, metastasis, therapy resistance and immune reactions, are tightly regulated by autophagy, supporting the conclusion that autophagy is a promising target in cancer therapy."

So far, aging and, eventually, death are unavoidable. Nevertheless, research efforts on aging-associated diseases with the aim not only to extend life span but also to increment health span in an attempt to delay, stop and even reverse the aging process have not stopped growing. Caloric restriction extends both health and life span in several short-lived experimental models and has brought to light the role of different molecular effectors involved in nutrient sensing pathways and longevity. This opens the possibility of modulating these molecular effectors also in humans to increase longevity and health span. The difficulty to implement caloric restricted diets in humans has led to the development of new bearable diets such as time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting or diets with limited amounts of some nutrients and to the search of pharmacological agents, targeted to the effectors that mediate the extension of life and health span in response to these anti-aging diets. Pharmacological approaches that eliminate senescent cells or prevent primary causes of aging such as telomere attrition also emerge as potential anti-aging strategies. In the present article, we review these possible nutritional and pharmacological interventions designed to mitigate and/or delay the aging process and to increase health and life span."

Moderating the accrual of these defunct components is likely a key in the promotion of longevity. While exercise is known to promote healthy aging and mitigate age-related pathologies, the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon remain largely unclear. However, recent evidences suggest that exercise modulates the proteome. Similarly, caloric restriction (CR), a known promoter of lifespan, is understood to augment intracellular protein quality. Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved recycling pathway responsible for the degradation, then turnover of cellular proteins and organelles. This housekeeping system has been reliably linked to the aging process. Moreover, autophagic activity declines during aging. The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a central kinase involved in protein translation, is a negative regulator of autophagy, and inhibition of TORC1 enhances lifespan. Inhibition of TORC1 may reduce the production of cellular proteins which may otherwise contribute to the deleterious accumulation observed in aging. TORC1 may also exert its effects in an autophagy-dependent manner. Exercise and CR result in a concomitant downregulation of TORC1 activity and upregulation of autophagy in a number of tissues. Moreover, exercise-induced TORC1 and autophagy signaling share common pathways with that of CR. Therefore, the longevity effects of exercise and CR may stem from the maintenance of the proteome by balancing the synthesis and recycling of intracellular proteins and thus may represent practical means to promote longevity."

            "abstract": "Across the lifespan, the human body and brain endure the impact of a plethora of exogenous and endogenous factors that determine the health outcome in old age. The overwhelming inter-individual variance spans between progressive frailty with loss of autonomy to largely preserved physical, cognitive, and social functions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the diverse aging trajectories can inform future strategies to maintain a healthy body and brain. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature on lifetime factors governing brain health. We present the growing body of evidence that unhealthy alimentary regime, sedentary behaviour, sleep pathologies, cardio-vascular risk factors, and chronic inflammation exert their harmful effects in a cumulative and gradual manner, and that timely and efficient intervention could promote healthy and successful aging. We discuss the main effects and interactions between these risk factors and the resulting brain health outcomes to follow with a description of current strategies aiming to eliminate, treat, or counteract the risk factors. We conclude that the detailed insights about modifiable risk factors could inform personalized multi-domain strategies for brain health maintenance on the background of increased longevity."

            "abstract": "Nearly a century of research has shown that nutritional interventions can delay aging and age- related diseases in many animal models and possibly humans. The most robust and widely studied intervention is caloric restriction, while protein restriction and restriction of various amino acids (methionine, tryptophan) have also been shown to delay aging. However, there is still debate over whether the major impact on aging is secondary to caloric intake, protein intake or specific amino acids. Nutritional geometry provides new perspectives on the relationship between nutrition and aging by focusing on calories, macronutrients and their interactions across a landscape of diets, and taking into account compensatory feeding in ad libitum-fed experiments. Nutritional geometry is a state-space modelling approach that explores how animals respond to and balance changes in nutrient availability. Such studies in insects and mice have shown that low protein, high carbohydrate diets are associated with longest lifespan in ad libitum fed animals suggesting that the interaction between macronutrients may be as important as their total intake."

            "abstract": "Aging is characterized by genomic instability and dysregulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. This work explores the impact of dysregulated miRNA biogenesis on the aging process. During aging, alterations in the transcription of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) occur due to genomic changes, DNA damage, and epigenetic modifications. The microprocessor complex, comprising DGCR8 and Drosha proteins, is vital for pri-miRNA processing. Age-related changes in this complex affect miRNA biogenesis and miRNA expression profiles, linking these alterations with age-related conditions. Conversely, interventions like caloric restriction and mTOR inhibition enhance microprocessor activity, suggesting a connection between microprocessor function, aging-related pathways, and lifespan extension. Exportin-5 mediates the transport of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although the role of miRNA export in aging is not well understood, accelerated export of pre-miRNAs is observed in response to DNA damage, and nucleocytoplasmic transport has been linked to cellular senescence. Dicer is responsible for processing pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Reduced Dicer expression during aging is reported in various organisms and tissues and is associated with premature aging phenotypes. Conversely, the upregulation of Dicer improves stress resistance and metabolic adaptations induced by caloric restriction and exercise training. Understanding the role of miRNA biogenesis disruption in aging provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases. Targeting this pathway may hold promise for therapeutic strategies and contribute to healthy aging."

Age-specific nutritional recommendations may help to decrease the incidence or severity of age-related debilitating chronic disorders. However, research in this area has seen limited success in identifying nutrition-related mechanisms that underlie the functional loss and chronic conditions that occur as a function of time. We believe that the limited success in establishing age-specific nutrition recommendations for the older population reflects, at least in part, research designs that fail to consider the evolutionary and biological bases of aging and longevity. Longevity has evolved as a by-product of genes selected for their contribution in helping the organism survive to the age of reproduction. As such, the principle of genetic determinism provides an appropriate underlying theory for research designs evaluating nutritional factors involved with life span. Aging is not a product of evolution and reflects stochastic and/or random events that most likely begin during the early, reproductively-active years. The genetic determinism model by which young (normal, control) are compared to old (abnormal, experimental) groups will not be effective in identifying underlying mechanisms and nutritional factors that impact aging. The purpose of this commentary is to briefly discuss the difference between aging and longevity and why knowing the difference is important to nutrition research and to establishing the most precise nutritional recommendations possible for the older population."

Second, we discuss the importance of the nonhuman primate nutrition and aging studies and the extent to which the outcomes of two ongoing long-term studies of caloric restriction are congruent with short-term equivalent studies in humans. Third, we showcase a number of pharmacological agents previously employed in nonhuman primate studies that display some potential as caloric restriction mimetics. Finally, we present nonhuman primates as an important model for translation of mechanisms of delayed aging identified in studies of shorter-lived animals. Proof of efficacy and safety of candidate longevity agents in nonhuman primates would be a cost-effective means to bring these exciting new avenues a step closer to clinical application."

Recent studies challenge this theory by demonstrating that in some cases, longevity is enhanced by inactivation of oxidative stress defenses or is correlated with increased, rather than decreased reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. Here we show that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, caloric restriction or inactivation of catalases extends chronological lifespan by inducing elevated levels of the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, which activate superoxide dismutases that inhibit the accumulation of superoxide anions. Increased hydrogen peroxide in catalase-deficient cells extends chronological lifespan despite parallel increases in oxidative damage. These findings establish a role for hormesis effects of hydrogen peroxide in promoting longevity that have broad implications for understanding aging and age-related diseases."

The underlying mechanisms by which the benefits of caloric restriction occur have not yet been clearly defined. However, many studies are being conducted in an attempt to elucidate these mechanisms, and there are indications that the benefits of caloric restriction are related to alteration of the metabolic rate and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. During molecular signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling, target of rapamycin pathway, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase signaling, and Sirtuin are focused as underlying pathways that mediate the benefits of caloric restriction. Here, we will review the current status of caloric restriction."

We review here novel CR mimetics and anti-aging compounds, such as 4,4'-dimethoxychalcone, fungal polysaccharides, inorganic nitrate, and trientine, highlighting their possible molecular targets and mechanisms of action. The activity of these compounds can be understood within the context of hormesis, a biphasic dose response that involves beneficial effects at low or moderate doses and toxic effects at high doses. The concept of hormesis has widespread implications for the identification of CR mimetics in experimental assays, testing in clinical trials, and use in healthy humans.

Estimates put the genetic effect from 5 to 35% approximately, suggesting that even genetic effects are dependent on environmental conditions. This contention is largely confirmed by the study of identical twins raised apart. They do not die at the same age and also for different reasons. Aging is not \"genetically programmed\", it is outside evolutionary constraint. Evolution favors early and efficient reproduction, but does not care for longevity. A number of mechanisms were shown to be involved in the age-dependent decline of vital functions, among them the Maillard reaction (non-enzymatic glycosylation) and the age-dependent upregulation of proteolytic activity. Aging of ECM is a complex process, comprising progressive modification of its macromolecular components and of cell-matrix interactions. An important process is the uncoupling with age of the elastin-receptor from its \"young\" transmission pathway loosing all physiological effects, but enhancing free radical and elastase release. These processes contribute to age-related ECM degradation, production of matrikins (ECM degradation products with biological activity) aggravating functional loss with age. Both genetic and post-genetic mechanisms are susceptible to be influenced by medical, pharmacological and dietary interventions. Among the genetic mechanisms, those attributed to Sirtuins (7 orthologs identified in the human genome) are especially important. Among the environmental effects, nutrition, hygiene and weather conditions play a role. These data justify some predictions on the evolution of life expectancy taking in account also socio-economic factors. Biological constraints become evident by the comparison of centenarians and supercentenarians (less than 1% of the centenarians) putting an upper limit to the attainable human lifespan."

However, it has also been shown that reduced calorie intake is often ineffective in extending life span. Selecting optimal dietary regimens for DR studies is complicated, as the same regimen may lead to different outcomes depending on genotype and environmental factors. Recent studies suggested that interventions such as moderate protein restriction with or without adequate nutrition (e.g., particular amino acids or carbohydrates) may have additional beneficial effects mediated by certain metabolic and hormonal factors implicated in the biology of aging, regardless of total calorie intake. In particular, it was shown that restriction of a single amino acid, methionine, can mimic the effects of DR and extend life span in various model organisms. We discuss the beneficial effects of a methionine-restricted diet, the molecular pathways involved, and the use of this regimen in longevity interventions."

Moreover, low T(b) has been shown to improve health and longevity independent of CR. In this review we examine the connections between CR, T(b) and mechanisms that influence longevity and ageing. Recent findings regarding the overlapping mechanisms of CR and T(b) that benefit longevity are discussed, including changes in body composition, hormone regulation, and gene expression, as well as reductions in low-level inflammation and reactive oxygen species-induced molecular damage. This information is summarized in a model describing how CR and low T(b), both synergistically and independently, increase lifespan. Moreover, the nascent notion that the rate of ageing may be pre-programmed in response to environmental influences at critical periods of early development is also considered. Based on current evidence, it is concluded that low T(b) plays an integral role in mediating the effects of CR on health and longevity, and that low T(b) may exert independent biological changes that increase lifespan. Our understanding of the overlap between CR- and T(b)-mediated longevity remains incomplete and should be explored in future research."

RECENT FINDINGS: Caloric restriction is a research priority for the US National Institute on Aging. However, little is known regarding health effects in humans. Some caloric restriction-related outcomes, such as cause-specific mortality and lifespan, are not practical for human clinical trials. Therefore, epidemiological data on older Okinawans, who experienced a caloric restriction-like diet for close to half their lives, are of special interest. The nutritional data support mild caloric restriction (10-15%) and high consumption of foods that may mimic the biological effects of caloric restriction, including sweet potatoes, marine-based carotenoid-rich foods, and turmeric. Phenotypic evidence is consistent with caloric restriction (including short stature, low body weight, and lean BMI), less age-related chronic disease (including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and dementia), and longer lifespan (mean and maximum). SUMMARY: Both caloric restriction and traditional Okinawan functional foods with caloric restriction-mimetic properties likely had roles in the extended healthspan and lifespan of the Okinawans. More research is needed on health consequences of caloric restriction and foods with caloric restriction-mimetic properties to identify possible nutritional interventions for healthy aging."

We herein describe common signatures of CR and suggest how they can slow aging. We discuss recent advances in understanding the function of key metabolic regulators that probably coordinate the response to altered nutrient availability with CR and how the pathways they regulate can retard the aging process."

Recent reports of nutritional geometry, including rodent models, highlight the impact macronutrients have on whole organismal aging outcomes. However, other environmental factors (e.g., ambient temperature) may alter nutrient preferences and requirements revealing context specific outcomes. Herein we highlight factors that influence the energetic and nutrient demands of organisms which oftentimes have underappreciated impacts on clarifying interventional effects on health and longevity in aging studies and subsequent translation to improve the human condition."

Polyphenols, ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables, have emerged as well-tolerated CR mimetics that target mitochondrial turnover.

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), a gastrointestinal peptide hormone, exerts various effects on pancreatic β-cells and extra-pancreatic tissues. GIP promotes glucose-dependent augmentation of insulin secretion and uptake of nutrients into the adipose tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gipr<sup>-/-</sup> and Gipr<sup>+/+</sup> mice were used for lifespan analysis, behavior experiments and gene expression of adipose tissue and muscles. 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes were used for Sirt1 and Nampt expression followed by treatment with GIP and α-lipoic acid. RESULTS: We observed that GIP receptor-knockout (Gipr<sup>-/-</sup>) mice fed normal diet showed an extended lifespan, increased exploratory and decreased anxiety-based behaviors, which are characteristic behavioral changes under CR. Moreover, Gipr<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed increased Sirt1 and Nampt expression in the adipose tissue. GIP suppressed α-lipoic acid-induced Sirt1 expression and activity in differentiated adipocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Although maintenance of CR is difficult, food intake and muscle endurance of Gipr<sup>-/-</sup> mice were similar to those of wild-type mice. Inhibition of GIP signaling may be a novel strategy to extend the lifespan of diabetic patients."

CR shares multiple overlapping pathways with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), particularly in energy metabolism and inflammation. Consequently, several lines of evidence suggest that PPARs might be indispensable for beneficial outcomes related to CR. In this review, we present the available evidence for the interconnection between CR and PPARs, highlighting their shared pathways and analyzing their interaction. We also discuss the possible contributions of PPARs to the effects of CR on whole organism outcomes."

This article focuses on the possible biological mechanisms underlying the antiaging action. The following three proposed mechanisms are considered in depth: 1) attenuation of oxidative damage; 2) modulation of glycemia and insulinemia; 3) hormesis. The evolution of the antiaging action of CR is also considered. Based on this consideration, a scenario unifying the above mechanisms is presented."

Regulation of these epigenetic mechanisms has been shown to have notable influences on the formation and progression of various neoplasms. We have shown that an epigenetic diet can influence both cellular longevity and carcinogenesis through the modulation of certain key genes that encode telomerase and p16. Caloric restriction (CR) can also play a crucial role in aging and cancer. Reductions in caloric intake have been shown to increase both the life- and health-span in a variety of animal models. Moreover, restriction of glucose has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of age-related diseases such as cancer and diabetes. A diet rich in compounds such as genistein, SFN and EGCG can positively modulate the epigenome and lead to many health benefits. Also, reducing the quantity of calories and glucose in the diet can confer an increased health-span, including reduced cancer incidence."

This unfortunate phenomenon inevitably leads to a decline in functionality and a heightened susceptibility to the ultimate fate of mortality. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to implement interventions that possess the capability to reverse or preempt age-related pathology. Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) refer to a class of molecules that have been observed to elicit advantageous outcomes on both health and longevity in various model organisms and human subjects. Notably, these compounds offer a promising alternative to the arduous task of adhering to a caloric restriction diet and mitigate the progression of the aging process and extend the duration of life in laboratory animals and human population. A plethora of molecular signals have been linked to the practice of caloric restriction, encompassing Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1), Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), the Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) pathway, and Sirtuins, with particular emphasis on SIRT1. Therefore, this review will center its focus on several compounds that act as CRMs, highlighting their molecular targets, chemical structures, and mechanisms of action. Moreover, this review serves to underscore the significant relationship between post COVID-19 syndrome, antiaging, and importance of utilizing CRMs. This particular endeavor will serve as a comprehensive guide for medicinal chemists and other esteemed researchers, enabling them to meticulously conceive and cultivate novel molecular entities with the potential to function as efficacious antiaging pharmaceutical agents."

The prevailing evolutionary hypothesis suggests the DR response redirects metabolic resources towards somatic maintenance at the expense of investment in reproduction. Consequently, DR acts as a proximate mechanism which promotes a pro-longevity phenotype. This idea is known as resource reallocation. However, growing findings suggest this paradigm could be incomplete. It has been argued that during DR it is not always possible to identify a trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. It is also suggested the relationship between reproduction and somatic maintenance can be uncoupled by the removal or inclusion of specific nutrients. These findings have created an imperative to re-explore the nexus between DR and evolutionary theory. In this review I will address this evolutionary conundrum. My overarching objectives are fourfold: (1) to outline some of the evidence for and against resource reallocation; (2) to examine recent findings which have necessitated a theoretical re-evaluation of the link between life history theory and DR; (3) to present alternatives to the resource reallocation model; (4) to present emerging variables which potentially influence how DR effects evolutionary trade-offs."

Accordingly, interventions are needed for delaying or preventing disorders associated with the ageing process, i.e., promotion of healthy ageing. Calorie restriction is the only nongenetic and the most robust approach to slow the process of ageing in evolutionarily divergent species, ranging from yeasts, worms, and flies to mammals. Although it has been known for more than 80 years that calorie restriction increases lifespan, a mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. Yeast silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), the founding member of the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases, and its mammalian homologue Sir2-like protein 1 (SIRT1), have been suggested to promote survival and longevity of organisms. SIRT1 exerts protective effects against a number of age-associated disorders. Caloric restriction increases both Sir2 and SIRT1 activity. This review focuses on the mechanistic insights between caloric restriction and Sir2/SIRT1 activation. A number of molecular links, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide, biotin, and related metabolites, are suggested to be the most important conduits mediating caloric restriction-induced Sir2/SIRT1 activation and lifespan extension."

            "abstract": "The World Health Organization predicts that by 2050, 2.1 billion people worldwide will be over 60 years old, a drastic increase from only 1 billion in 2019. Considering these numbers, strategies to ensure an extended \"healthspan\" or healthy longevity are urgently needed. The present study approaches the promotion of healthspan from an epigenetic perspective. Epigenetic phenomena are modifiable in response to an individual's environmental exposures, and therefore link an individual's environment to their gene expression pattern. Epigenetic studies demonstrate that aging is associated with decondensation of the chromatin, leading to an altered heterochromatin structure, which promotes the accumulation of errors. In this review, we describe how aging impacts epigenetics and how nutrition and physical exercise can positively impact the aging process, from an epigenetic point of view. Canonical histones are replaced by histone variants, concomitant with an increase in histone post-translational modifications. A slight increase in DNA methylation at promoters has been observed, which represses transcription of previously active genes, in parallel with global genome hypomethylation. Aging is also associated with deregulation of gene expression - usually provided by non-coding RNAs - leading to both the repression of previously transcribed genes and to the transcription of previously repressed genes. Age-associated epigenetic events are less common in individuals with a healthy lifestyle, including balanced nutrition, caloric restriction and physical exercise. Healthy aging is associated with more tightly condensed chromatin, fewer PTMs and greater regulation by ncRNAs."

            "abstract": "Sirtuins may counteract at least six hallmarks of organismal aging: neurodegeneration, chronic but ineffective inflammatory response, metabolic syndrome, DNA damage, genome instability, and cancer incidence. Moreover, caloric restriction is believed to slow down aging by boosting the activity of some sirtuins through activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus raising the level of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) by stimulating NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis. Sirtuins and their downstream effectors induce intracellular signaling pathways related to a moderate caloric restriction within cells, mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell senescence phenotype (CSP) induction, and apoptosis as forms of the cellular stress response. Instead, it can promote DNA damage repair and survival of cells with normal, completely functional phenotypes. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of sirtuins action toward cell-conserving phenotype associated with intracellular signaling pathways related to moderate caloric restriction, as well as some tissue-specific functions of sirtuins, especially in the central nervous system, heart muscle, skeletal muscles, liver, kidneys, white adipose tissue, hematopoietic system, and immune system. In this context, we discuss the possibility of new therapeutic approaches."

Among age-related diseases, the incidence of cancer has grown substantially, in part because of the overlap of some molecular pathways between cancer and aging. Studies with model organisms suggest that aging and age-related conditions are manipulable processes that can be modified by both genetic and environmental factors, including dietary habits. Variations in genetic backgrounds likely lead to differential responses to dietary changes and account for some of the inconsistencies found in the literature. The intricacies of the aging process, coupled with the interrelational role of bioactive food components on gene expression, make this review a complex undertaking. Nevertheless, intriguing evidence suggests that dietary habits can manipulate the aging process and/or its consequences and potentially may have unprecedented health benefits. The present review focuses on 4 cellular events: telomerase activity, bioenergetics, DNA repair, and oxidative stress. These processes are linked to both aging and cancer risk, and their alteration in animal models by selected food components is evident."

Though biological changes that occur through the natural process of aging cannot be controlled, the risk factors associated with lifestyle can. Thus, the main goal of this systematic review was to evaluate how nutrition can modulate aging. For this purpose, thirty-six studies were selected on (i) the efficiency of nutrition's effect on aging, (ii) the evaluation of biomarkers that promote healthy aging, and (iii) how to increase longevity through nutrition, and their quality was assessed. The results showed that choosing low carbohydrate diets or diets rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, cereals, fish, and unsaturated fats, containing antioxidants, potassium, and omega-3 decreased cardiovascular diseases and obesity risk, protected the brain from aging, reduced the risk of telomere shortening, and promoted an overall healthier life. With this study, the conclusion is that since the biological processes of aging cannot be controlled, changing one's nutritional patterns is crucial to prevent the emergence and development of diseases, boost longevity, and, mostly, to enhance one's quality of life and promote healthy aging."

Central to this process are molecular and cellular changes that contribute to hallmark features of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, telomere attrition, and cellular senescence. Emerging research highlights the role of nutrient deficiencies in accelerating aging, bringing dietary supplements such as taurine and berberine into focus. Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, plays a critical role in cellular protection, osmoregulation, and antioxidant defense, with evidence linking its deficiency to cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, exerts antiaging effects by modulating key signaling pathways, including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin and sirtuin 1, and promoting mitohormesis. This review explores the mechanisms by which taurine and berberine mitigate aging processes, highlighting their effects on cellular metabolism, stress response, and longevity. Animal studies demonstrate their potential to enhance health span and lifespan although human clinical trials remain limited. Future research should focus on elucidating their molecular pathways, evaluating their combined effects with other interventions such as caloric restriction, and optimizing dosage for clinical applications. Taurine and berberine represent promising therapeutic candidates for addressing fundamental aspects of aging and advancing strategies for healthy aging and lifespan extension."

There is a growing evidence that pre-clinical stage of many neurodegenerative diseases involves changes in interactions between astrocytes and neurons. Conversely, astrocytes are strategically positioned to mediate the positive influence of physical activity and diet on neuronal function. Thus, development of therapeutic agents which could improve the astroglia-neuron communications in ageing brain is of crucial importance. Recent advances in studies of cellular mechanisms of brain longevity suggest that astrocyte-neuron communications have a vital role in the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, physical exercise and their pharmacological mimetics on synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function. In particular, our recent data indicate that noradrenaline uptake inhibitor atomoxetine can enhance astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and astroglia-driven modulation of synaptic plasticity. Similar effects were exhibited by caloric restriction-mimetics metformin and resveratrol. The emerged data also suggest that astrocytes could be involved in the modulatory action of caloric restriction and its mimetics on neuronal autophagy. Still, the efficiency of astrocyte-targeting compounds in preventing age-related cognitive decline is yet to be fully explored, in particular in the animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and autophagy impairment."

Yeast CLS assays monitor the loss of cell viability in a culture over time, and this new assay shows a continuous decline in viability without detectable regrowth until all cells in the culture are dead. Thus, the survival curve is not altered by the generation of mutants that can grow during the experiments, and one can monitor the entire lifespan of a strain until the number of viable cells has decreased over 10(6)-fold. This CLS assay recapitulates the evolutionarily conserved features of lifespan shortening by over nutrition, lifespan extension by caloric restriction, increased stress resistance of calorically restricted cells and lifespan control by the AKT kinases. Both S. pombe AKT kinase orthologs regulate CLS: loss of sck1(+) extended lifespan in over nutrition conditions, loss of sck2(+) extended lifespan under both normal and over nutrition conditions, and loss of both genes showed that sck1(+) and sck2(+) control different longevity pathways. The longest-lived S. pombe cells showed the most efficient cell cycle exit, demonstrating that caloric restriction links these two processes. This new S. pombe CLS assay will provide a valuable tool for aging research."

Caloric restriction (CR) alleviates obesity phenotypes and delays the onset of age-related changes. However, how late in life organisms benefit from switching from a high-(H) to a low-calorie (L) diet is unclear. We transferred male flies from a H to a L (HL) diet or vice versa (LH) at different times during life. Both shifts immediately change fly rate of aging even when applied late in life. HL shift rapidly reduces fly mortality rate to briefly lower rate than in flies on a constant L diet, and extends lifespan. Transcriptomic analysis uncovers that flies aged on H diet have acquired increased stress response, which may have temporal advantage over flies aged on L diet and leads to rapid decrease in mortality rate after HL switch. Conversely, a LH shift increases mortality rate, which is temporarily higher than in flies aged on a H diet, and shortens lifespan. Unexpectedly, more abundant transcriptomic changes accompanied LH shift, including increase in ribosome biogenesis, stress response and growth. These changes reflect protection from sudden release of ROS, energy storage, and use of energy to growth, which all likely contribute to higher mortality rate. As the beneficial effects of CR on physiology and lifespan are conserved across many organisms, our study provides framework to study underlying mechanisms of CR interventions that counteract the detrimental effects of H diets and reduce rate of aging even when initiated later in life."

However, most are upstream signaling hubs or transcription factors orchestrating complex anti-aging programs. Therefore, these molecules point to but do not reveal the fundamental mechanisms driving longevity. Instead, downstream effectors that are necessary and sufficient to promote longevity across conditions or organisms may reveal the fundamental anti-aging drivers. Toward this goal, we searched for effectors acting downstream of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), known as HLH-30 in C. elegans, because TFEB/HLH-30 is necessary across anti-aging interventions and its overexpression is sufficient to extend C. elegans lifespan and reduce biomarkers of aging in mammals including humans. As a result, we present an alcohol-dehydrogenase-mediated anti-aging response (AMAR) that is essential for C. elegans longevity driven by HLH-30 overexpression, caloric restriction, mTOR inhibition, and insulin-signaling deficiency. The sole overexpression of ADH-1 is sufficient to activate AMAR, which extends healthspan and lifespan by reducing the levels of glycerol-an age-associated and aging-promoting alcohol. Adh1 overexpression is also sufficient to promote longevity in yeast, and adh-1 orthologs are induced in calorically restricted mice and humans, hinting at ADH-1 acting as an anti-aging effector across phyla."

This effect of caloric restriction (CR) on lifespan has been reported in nearly all species tested and has been reproduced hundreds of times under a variety of different laboratory conditions. In addition to prolonging lifespan, CR also prevents or delays the onset of age-related disease and maintains many physiological functions at more youthful levels. Studies in longer-lived species, specifically rhesus and squirrel monkeys, have been underway since the late 1980s. The studies in nonhuman primates are beginning to yield valuable information suggesting that the effect of CR on aging is universal across species and that this nutritional paradigm will have similar effects in humans. Even if CR can be shown to impact upon human aging, it is unlikely that most people will be able to maintain the strict dietary control required for this regimen. Thus, elucidation of the biological mechanisms of CR and development of alternative strategies to yield similar benefits is of primary importance. CR mimetics, or interventions that \"mimic\" certain protective effects of CR, may represent one such alternative strategy."

When sequenced, many of these genes exhibited significant homology to genes in the mammalian insulin signaling cascade. For example, the daf-2 gene that has been shown to regulate lifespan in C elegans shares significant sequence homology with the insulin and IGF-1 receptor genes in mammals. Another longevity gene in the nematode, age-1, is homologous with the p110 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in mammals. This enzyme functions early in the mammalian insulin response cascade to influence many important cellular growth and metabolic processes. These findings and others have led to the suggestion that lifespan regulation in nematodes is controlled by a mechanism similar to that involved in lifespan extension by caloric restriction in mammals. Many intriguing similarities exist between these two model systems providing some support for this idea. However, at present there is insufficient data to conclude that similar genes or mechanisms regulate lifespan determination in nematodes and in mammals."

Low levels of these parameters are also typical traits of long-lived mammals and birds. However, it is not known what dietary components are responsible for these changes during CR. It was recently observed that 40% protein restriction without strong CR also decreases MitROS generation and oxidative stress. This is interesting because protein restriction also increases maximum longevity (although to a lower extent than CR) and is a much more practicable intervention for humans than CR. Moreover, it was recently found that 80% methionine restriction substituting it for l-glutamate in the diet also decreases MitROS generation in rat liver. Thus, methionine restriction seems to be responsible for the decrease in ROS production observed in caloric restriction. This is interesting because it is known that exactly that procedure of methionine restriction also increases maximum longevity. Moreover, recent data show that methionine levels in tissue proteins negatively correlate with maximum longevity in mammals and birds. All these suggest that lowering of methionine levels is involved in the control of mitochondrial oxidative stress and vertebrate longevity by at least two different mechanisms: decreasing the sensitivity of proteins to oxidative damage, and lowering of the rate of ROS generation at mitochondria."

Nutrition is at the heart of the World Health Organization (WHO) Sustainable Development Goals, particularly for Sustainable Development Goal 2/Subgoal 2, which is to <i>End all forms of malnutrition by 2030</i>. This subgoal addresses people of all ages, including targeted groups like young children and older adults. In recent decades, there have been marked advances in the tools and methods used to screen for risk of malnutrition and to conduct nutritional assessments. There have also been innovations in nutritional interventions and outcome measures related to malnutrition. What has been less common is research on how nutritional interventions can impact healthy aging. Our <i>Perspective</i> article thus takes a life-course approach to consider what is needed to address risk of malnutrition and why, and to examine how good nutrition across the lifespan can contribute to healthy aging. We discuss broad-ranging yet interdependent ways to improve nutritional status worldwide-development of nutritional programs and policies, incorporation of the best nutrition-care tools and methods into practice, provision of professional training for quality nutritional care, and monitoring health and economic benefits of such changes. Taken together, our <i>Perspective</i> aims to (i) identify current challenges to meeting these ideals of nutritional care, and to (ii) discover enabling strategies for the improvement of nutrition care across the lifespan. In harmony with the WHO goal of sustainable development, we underscore roles of nutrition to foster healthy human development and healthy aging worldwide."

Therefore, an important question is whether there are age-related changes in intestinal nutrient absorption which may contribute to a decline in absorptive capacity. Sugar and amino acid transport per mg intestine generally decreases with age. The proximate mechanism underlying this age-related decrease in transport activity is a decrease in number of transporters per mg. This reduction in transporter number can be caused by age-related changes in cell proliferation rates which, in turn, can alter the ratio of absorptive to nonabsorptive cells. The age-related change in proliferation rates typically increases intestinal mass. There seems to be no age-related changes in the steady state levels of transporter mRNA. Aging also modestly impairs the ability of intestinal nutrient transport systems to adapt to changes in dietary conditions. Caloric restriction is the only procedure known to consistently increase the lifespan of mammals. Chronic caloric restriction markedly enhances intestinal nutrient transport per mg without affecting intestinal mass. Since body weight decreases with caloric restriction, there is a dramatic increase in intestinal absorptive capacity normalized to body weight. This suggests that an increase in intestinal nutrient absorption may be a critical adaptation to caloric restriction. There is a need to perform in vivo transport studies during senescence, to distinguish between acute and chronic effects of caloric restriction, and to identify hormones that may mediate aging and caloric restriction effects on intestinal nutrient transport."

Because ghrelin is increased by caloric restriction, ghrelin may play an important role in the mechanism of longevity mediated by calorie restriction. In this review, we will discuss the role of orexigenic peptides with a particular focus on ghrelin. We conclude that the ghrelin-growth hormone secretagogue-R signaling pathway may play an important role in the anti-aging mechanism."

The purpose of this review, therefore, is to discuss findings on MT that are relevant to basic aging mechanisms and to draw attention to the possible role of MT in pro-longevity interventions. MT is one of just a handful of proteins that, when overexpressed, has been demonstrated to increase mouse lifespan. MT also protects against development of obesity in mice provided a high fat diet as well as diet-induced oxidative stress damage. Abundance of MT is responsive to caloric restriction (CR) and inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway, and elevated MT gene expression has been observed in tissues from fasted and CR-fed mice, long-lived dwarf mice, worms maintained under CR conditions, and long-lived daf-2 mutant worms. The dysregulation of MT in these systems is likely to have tissue-specific effects on aging outcomes. Further investigation will therefore be needed to understand how MT contributes to the response of invertebrates and mice to CR and the endocrine mutations studied by aging researchers."

Most longevity interventions in model organisms extend healthspan, but it is not known whether they compress sickspan relative to the lifespan. Here, we present a theory that predicts which interventions compress relative sickspan, based on the shape of the survival curve. Interventions such as caloric restriction that extend mean lifespan while preserving the shape of the survival curve, are predicted to extend the sickspan proportionally, without compressing it. Conversely, a subset of interventions that extend lifespan and steepen the shape of the survival curve are predicted to compress the relative sickspan. We explain this based on the saturating-removal mathematical model of aging, and present evidence from longitudinal health data in mice, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We apply this theory to identify potential interventions for compressing the sickspan in mice, and to combinations of longevity interventions. This approach offers potential strategies for compressing morbidity and extending healthspan."

Processes through which caloric restriction promotes lifespan include obesity-countering weight loss, increased DNA repair, control of ribosomal and telomeric DNA repeats, mitochondrial regulation, activation of antioxidants, and protective autophagy. Several of these protective cellular processes are linked to the suppression of TOR (target of rapamycin) or the activation of sirtuins. In stark contrast, CR fails to extend or even shortens lifespan in certain settings. CR-dependent lifespan shortening is linked to weight loss in the non-obese, mitochondrial hyperactivity, genomic inflexibility, and several other processes. Deciphering the balance between positive and negative effects of CR is critical to understanding its ultimate impact on aging. This knowledge is especially needed in order to fulfil the promise of using CR or its mimetic drugs to counteract age-associated diseases and unhealthy aging."

Consequently, dietary manipulations are the only practical and probable strategies to promote health and longevity in humans. Caloric restriction (CR), reduction of calorie intake to a level that does not compromise overall health, has been considered as being one of the most promising dietary interventions to extend lifespan in humans. Although it is straightforward, continuous reduction of calorie or food intake is not easy to practice in real lives of humans. Recently, fasting-related interventions such as intermittent fasting (IF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) have emerged as alternatives of CR. Here, we review the history of CR and fasting-related strategies in animal models, discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying these interventions, and propose future directions that can fill the missing gaps in the current understanding of these dietary interventions. CR and fasting appear to extend lifespan by both partially overlapping common mechanisms such as the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway and circadian clock, and distinct independent mechanisms that remain to be discovered. We propose that a systems approach combining global transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses followed by genetic perturbation studies targeting multiple candidate pathways will allow us to better understand how CR and fasting interact with each other to promote longevity."

Hence, alternative eating patterns and strategies that recapitulate the salutary benefits of caloric restriction are under intense investigation. Here, we first provide an overview of alternative interventions, including intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting and the Mediterranean diet, along with their cardiometabolic effects in animal models and humans. We then present emerging pharmacological alternatives, including spermidine, NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors, resveratrol, and metformin, as promising caloric restriction mimetics, and briefly touch on the mechanisms underpinning their cardiometabolic and health-promoting effects.

This progress has been confined primarily to model organisms, such as filamentous fungi, yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, and mice, in which some thirty-five genes that determine life span have been cloned. These genes encode a wide array of cellular functions, indicating that there must be multiple mechanisms of aging. Nevertheless, some generalizations are already beginning to emerge. It is now clear that there are at least four broad physiological processes that play a role in aging: metabolic control, resistance to stress, gene dysregulation, and genetic stability. The first two of these at least are common themes that connect aging in yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies, and this convergence extends to caloric restriction, which postpones senescence and increases life span in rodents. Many of the human homologs of the longevity genes found in model organisms have been identified. This will lead to their use as candidate human longevity genes in population genetic studies. The urgency for such studies is great: The population is graying, and this research holds the promise of improvement in the quality of the later years of life."

Comparative studies of animals with different aging rates have shown that the rate of mitochondrial oxygen radical generation is directly related to the steady-state level of oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and is inversely correlated with maximum longevity in higher vertebrates. The degree of unsaturation of tissue fatty acids also correlates inversely with maximum longevity. These are the two known traits connecting oxidative stress with aging. Furthermore, caloric restriction, which decreases the rate of aging, proportionately decreases mitochondrial oxygen radical generation, especially at complex I. These findings are reviewed, highlighting the results obtained in the brain."

            "abstract": "The review discusses the role of metabolic disorders (in particular, insulin resistance) in the development of age-related diseases and normal aging with special emphasis on the changes in postmitotic cells of higher organisms. Caloric restriction helps to prevent such metabolic disorders, which could probably explain its ability to prolong the lifespan of laboratory animals. Maintaining metabolic homeostasis is especially important for the highly differentiated long-lived body cells, whose lifespan is comparable to the lifespan of the organism itself. Normal functioning of these cells can be ensured only upon correct functioning of the cytoplasm clean-up system and availability of all required nutrients and energy sources. One of the central problems in gerontology is the age-related disruption of glucose metabolism leading to obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and other related pathologies. Along with the adipose tissue, skeletal muscles are the main consumers of insulin; hence the physical activity of muscles, which supports their energy metabolism, delays the onset of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance disrupts the metabolism of cardiomyocytes, so that they fail to utilize the nutrients to perform their functions even being surrounded by a nutrient-rich environment, which contributes to the development of age-related cardiovascular diseases. Metabolic pathologies also alter the nutrient sensitivity of neurons, thus disrupting the action of insulin in the central nervous system. In addition, there is evidence that neurons can develop insulin resistance as well. It has been suggested that affecting nutritional sensors (e.g., AMPK) in postmitotic cells might improve the state of the entire multicellular organism, slow down its aging, and increase the lifespan."

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, extensive efforts have focused on understanding age-associated diseases and how to prolong a healthy lifespan. The induction of dietary protocols such as caloric restriction (CR) and protein restriction (PR) has positively affected a healthy lifespan. These intervention ideas (nutritional protocols) have been the subject of human cohort studies and clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness in alleviating age-related diseases (such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and musculoskeletal fragility) and promoting human longevity. This study summarizes the literature on the nutritional protocols, emphasizing their impacts on bone and muscle biology. In addition, we analyzed several CR studies using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified common transcriptome changes to understand the signaling pathway involved in musculoskeletal tissue. We identified nine novel common genes, out of which five were upregulated (Emc3, Fam134b, Fbxo30, Pip5k1a, and Retsat), and four were downregulated (Gstm2, Per2, Fam78a, and Sel1l3) with CR in muscles. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that CR regulates several signaling pathways (e.g., circadian gene regulation and rhythm, energy reserve metabolic process, thermogenesis) involved in energy metabolism. In conclusion, this study summarizes the beneficiary role of CR and identifies novel genes and signaling pathways involved in musculoskeletal biology."

The anti-aging effect of caloric restriction (CR) might derive from these adaptive responses to maximize organism survival. The present article discusses the potential role for leptin, a hormone secreted from adipocytes, as a key signal that induces the adaptive responses relevant to CR. Evidence indicates that a CR-induced reduction of the plasma leptin concentration suppresses the gonadal, somatotropic, and thyroidal axes, and activates the adrenal axis. Metabolic adaptation, a shift in fuel utilization mainly conducted in the liver, seems to require leptin signaling. Although alternative signaling pathways might also mediate the anti-aging effects of CR, leptin signaling could be a substantial pathway involved in these effects. Molecular dissection of the mechanisms underlying the effects of CR will contribute to a better understanding of the aging process, leading to the extension of a healthy lifespan in humans."

            "abstract": "Available studies are consistent with the possibility that oxygen radicals endogenously produced by mitochondria are causally involved in the determination of the rate of aging in homeothermic vertebrates. Oxidative damage to tissue macromolecules seems to increase during aging. The rate of mitochondrial oxygen radical generation of post-mitotic tissues is negatively correlated with animal longevity. In agreement with this, long-lived animals show lower levels of oxidative damage in their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than short-lived ones, whereas this does not occur in nuclear DNA (nDNA). Caloric restriction, which decreases the rate of aging, also decreases mitochondrial oxygen radical generation and oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA. This decrease in free radical generation occurs in complex I and is due to a decrease in the degree of electronic reduction of the complex I free radical generator, similarly to what has been described in various cases in long-lived animals. These results suggest that similar mechanisms have been used to extend longevity through decreases in oxidative stress in caloric restriction and during the evolution of species with different longevities."

I apply the modern theory of complex adaptive systems (nonlinear, stochastic, dynamic methods) to questions of aging and longevity. I begin by highlighting major questions that must be answered in order to obtain a deeper understanding of aging. These are: (i) What should (in an evolutionary sense) mortality trajectories look like? (ii) Why does caloric restriction slow aging? (iii) Why does reproduction cause delayed mortality? (iv) Why does compensatory growth cause delayed mortality? I show how dynamic state variable models based on stochastic dynamic programming (Clark & Mangel, 2000) can be used to embed genetic theories of senescence (either mutation accumulation or antagonistic pleiotropy) in the somatic environment, as George Williams called for in 1957, and how they make the disposable soma theory of aging operational. Such models will allow unification of genetic and phenotypic theories of aging."

Their requirement for NAD(+) potentially makes them prone to regulation by fluctuations in NAD(+) or biosynthesis intermediates, thus linking them to cellular metabolism. The Sir2 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the founding sirtuin family member and has been well characterized as a histone deacetylase that functions in transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin domains and as a pro-longevity factor for replicative life span (RLS), defined as the number of times a mother cell divides (buds) before senescing. Deleting SIR2 shortens RLS, while increased gene dosage causes extension. Furthermore, Sir2 has been implicated in mediating the beneficial effects of caloric restriction (CR) on life span, not only in yeast, but also in higher eukaryotes. While this paradigm has had its share of disagreements and debate, it has also helped rapidly drive the aging research field forward. S. cerevisiae has four additional sirtuins, Hst1, Hst2, Hst3, and Hst4. This review discusses the function of Sir2 and the Hst homologs in replicative aging and chronological aging, and also addresses how the sirtuins are regulated in response to environmental stresses such as CR."

Caloric restriction has been found to induce cardiometabolic adaptations associated with improved health and to delay the onset and progression of kidney disease in different species, particularly in rodent models. In both aging and obesity, fibrosis is a hallmark of kidney disease, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a key process that leads to fibrosis and renal dysfunction during aging. In this study, we used an aged and obese rat model to evaluate the effect of long-term (6 months) caloric restriction (-40%) on renal damage both from a structural and functional point of view. Renal interstitial fibrosis was analyzed by histological techniques, whereas effects on mesenchymal (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Desmin and α-SMA), antioxidant (SOD1, SOD2, Catalase and GSTP1) inflammatory (YM1 and iNOS) markers and apoptotic/cell cycle (BAX, BCL2, pJNK, Caspase 3 and p27) pathways were investigated using Western blot analysis. Our results clearly showed that caloric restriction promotes cell cycle division and reduces apoptotic injury and fibrosis phenotype through inflammation attenuation and leukocyte infiltration. In conclusion, we highlight the beneficial effects of caloric restriction to preserve elderly kidney function."

Although the life span of the general population is increasing, the con of such a prolonged life span is that aging has certain detrimental effects on the molecular, structural, and functional elements of the cardiovascular system. This review will discuss various molecular pathways linked to longevity, most notably autophagy and its associated mechanisms, and how these pathways can be targeted to promote cardiovascular health through the process of aging. It is to be noted that the process of autophagy decreases with aging; hence, this review concludes that the promotion of autophagy, through implementation of caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and pharmacologic agents, has proven to be an efficacious means of stimulating cardiovascular health. Therefore, autophagy is an important target for prevention and procrastination of cardiovascular pathologies in the geriatric population."

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that extrinsic systemic manipulations such as exercise, caloric restriction, and changing blood composition by heterochronic parabiosis or young plasma administration can partially counteract this age-related loss of plasticity in the aged brain. In this review, we discuss the process of aging and rejuvenation as systemic events. We summarize genetic studies that demonstrate a surprising level of malleability in organismal lifespan, and highlight the potential for systemic manipulations to functionally reverse the effects of aging in the CNS. Based on mounting evidence, we propose that rejuvenating effects of systemic manipulations are mediated, in part, by blood-borne 'pro-youthful' factors. Thus, systemic manipulations promoting a younger blood composition provide effective strategies to rejuvenate the aged brain. As a consequence, we can now consider reactivating latent plasticity dormant in the aged CNS as a means to rejuvenate regenerative, synaptic, and cognitive functions late in life, with potential implications even for extending lifespan. We review evidence of brain rejuvenation focusing on several systemic manipulations - exercise, caloric restriction, heterochronic parabiosis, and young plasma administration - and their ability to restore regenerative capacity, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function in the brain."

In this mini-review, we briefly cover the historical views on the link between ageing and metabolic rate, highlight genetically modified transgenic mouse models of extended lifespan, discuss endocrine pathways linked to senescence and ageing, and then examine pathways by which caloric restriction is postulated to result in longevity."

Understanding the mechanisms involved will uncover future interventions for aging-associated diseases. In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CR is commonly defined by reduced glucose in the growth medium, which extends both replicative and chronological life span (CLS). We found that conditioned media collected from stationary-phase CR cultures extended CLS when supplemented into nonrestricted (NR) cultures, suggesting a potential cell-nonautonomous mechanism of CR-induced life span regulation. Chromatography and untargeted metabolomics of the conditioned media, as well as transcriptional responses associated with the longevity effect, pointed to specific amino acids enriched in the CR conditioned media (CRCM) as functional molecules, with L-serine being a particularly strong candidate. Indeed, supplementing L-serine into NR cultures extended CLS through a mechanism dependent on the one-carbon metabolism pathway, thus implicating this conserved and central metabolic hub in life span regulation."

Whereas caloric intake in animals comes from ingestion, in plants it derives from photosynthesis. Thus, factors that reduce photosynthesis, such as reduced light intensity, can induce CR. In two lab experiments investigating the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor, we tracked hundreds of individuals longitudinally, with light intensity-and hence, CR-manipulated using neutral-density filters. In both experiments, CR dramatically increased lifespan through a process of temporal scaling. Moreover, the magnitude of lifespan extension accorded with the assumptions that (a) light intensity positively relates to photosynthesis following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and (b) photosynthesis negatively relates to lifespan via a power law. Our results emphasize that CR-mediated lifespan extension applies to autotrophs as well as heterotrophs, and suggest that variation in light intensity has quantitatively predictable effects on plant aging trajectories."

Over decades of investigation, claims have been made that the paradigm produces the most robust demonstration that aging is malleable. In the current review of the rodent literature, we present arguments that question the robustness of the paradigm to increase lifespan and healthspan. Specifically, there are several questions to consider as follows: (1) At what age does CR no longer produce benefits? (2) Does CR attenuate cognitive decline? (3) Are there negative effects of CR, including effects on bone health, wound healing, and response to infection? (4) How important is schedule of feeding? (5) How long does CR need to be imposed to be effective? (6) How do genotype and gender influence CR? (7) What role does dietary composition play? Consideration of these questions produce many caveats that should guide future investigations to move the field forward."

We have discovered a geroprotective chemical compound of mammalian origin, a bile acid called lithocholic acid, which can delay chronological aging of the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under caloric restriction conditions. Here, we investigated mechanisms through which lithocholic acid can delay chronological aging of yeast limited in calorie supply. We provide evidence that lithocholic acid causes a stepwise development and maintenance of an aging-delaying cellular pattern throughout the entire chronological lifespan of yeast cultured under caloric restriction conditions. We show that lithocholic acid stimulates the aging-delaying cellular pattern and preserves such pattern because it specifically modulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of a complex cellular network. We demonstrate that this cellular network integrates certain pathways of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, some intercompartmental communications, mitochondrial morphology and functionality, and liponecrotic and apoptotic modes of aging-associated cell death. Our findings indicate that lithocholic acid prolongs longevity of chronologically aging yeast because it decreases the risk of aging-associated cell death, thus increasing the chance of elderly cells to survive."

The aging process is characterized by both global and tissue-specific changes in gene expression across taxonomically diverse species. While aging has historically been thought to entail cell-autonomous, even stochastic changes, recent evidence suggests that modulation of this process can be hierarchal, wherein manipulations of nutrient-sensing neurons (e.g., in the hypothalamus) produce peripheral effects that may modulate the aging process itself. The most robust intervention extending lifespan, plausibly impinging on the aging process, involves different modalities of dietary restriction (DR). Lifespan extension by DR is associated with broad protection against diseases (natural and engineered). Here we review potential epigenetic processes that may link lifespan to age-related diseases, particularly in the context of DR and (other) ketogenic diets, focusing on brain and hypothalamic mechanisms."

Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have indicated that changes in various histone modifications have a significant influence on the aging process. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the abundance and localization of histone modifications are responsive to various environmental stimuli, such as diet, which can also affect gene expression and lifespan. This supports the notion that histone modifications can serve as a main cellular platform for signal integration. Hence, in this review we focus on the role of histone modifications during aging, report the data indicating that diet affects histone modification levels and explore the idea that histone modifications may function as an intersection through which diet regulates lifespan. A greater understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that link environmental signals to longevity may provide new strategies for therapeutic intervention in age-related diseases and for promoting healthy aging."

The aging process is associated with several cellular and organic functional alterations that, at the end, cause multi-organic cell failure. Epigenetic mechanisms of aging are modifiable by appropriate preventive actions mediated by sirtuins, caloric input, diet components, adipose tissue-related inflammatory reactions, and physical activity. The Mediterranean lifestyle has been for many millennia a daily habit for people in Western civilizations living around the Mediterranean sea who worked intensively and survived with very few seasonal foods. A high adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with low mortality (higher longevity) and reduced risk of developing chronic diseases, including cancer, the metabolic syndrome, depression and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Reports indicate that some dietary components, such as olive oil, antioxidants, omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated acids, polyphenols and flavonoids, mediate beneficial anti-aging effects (anti-chronic diseases and increased longevity). Equally, physical activity displays a positive effect, producing caloric consumption and regulation of adipose and pancreatic function. The predictive strength of some food patterns may be a way of developing recommendations for food and health policies. This paper will discuss several ways of improving health during mid-life, focusing on certain groups of functional foods and healthy habits which may reduce or prevent age-related chronic diseases."

Special consideration deserve apoprotein E alleles, specially allele eee4 that is associated with development of Alzheimer disease, atheroesclerosis and a shorter life. However environmental influences on longevity are of utmost importance. In rats, mice and non human primates, caloric restriction prolongs life and retards the appearance of several conditions associated with aging. This effect of caloric restriction is probably due mainly to a reduction in the generation of primary and secondary reactive oxygen species. Noteworthy is the reduction of DNA oxidative damage and the consequent reduction in transcriptional defects. Telomeres, special structures located in the extremes of chromosomes, are specially susceptible to oxidative damage. This structures have been postulated to act as biological clocks of cells, since their progressive shortening is a signal to stop replication. In humans, telomeres shorten throughout life and in some diseases associated with premature aging such as trisomy 21 and Werner syndrome, the loss of telomeric bases occurs at a higher rate. The knowledge about environmental influences on aging will allow us to increase our life span and to reduce the disabilities associated with aging."

Nine hallmarks have been identified based on their alteration during aging and their capacity to increase longevity. The pathways and the molecular mechanisms to improve lifespan and healthspan are controlled by behavioral, pharmacologic and dietary factors, which remain largely unknown. Among them, naturally occurring compounds, such as polyphenols, are considered potential antiaging agents, because of their ability to modulate some of the evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of aging, including oxidative damage, inflammation, cell senescence, and autophagy. Initially, these compounds gained researchers' attention due to their ability to extend the lifespan of simple model organisms. More recently, some of them have been proposed as senolytic agents to protect against age-related disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The intent of this review is to present the most validated molecular mechanisms regulating ageing and longevity and critically analyze how selected polyphenols, namely resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin and catechins, can interfere with these mechanisms."

The aging process is frequently affected by environmental factors, and caloric restriction is by far the most effective and established environmental manipulation for extending lifespan in various animal models. However, the precise mechanisms by which caloric restriction affects lifespan are still not clear. Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been recognized as major contributors to nutrition-related longevity and aging control. Two primary epigenetic codes, DNA methylation and histone modification, are believed to dynamically influence chromatin structure, resulting in expression changes of relevant genes. In this review, we assess the current advances in epigenetic regulation in response to caloric restriction and how this affects cellular senescence, aging and potential extension of a healthy lifespan in humans. Enhanced understanding of the important role of epigenetics in the control of the aging process through caloric restriction may lead to clinical advances in the prevention and therapy of human aging-associated diseases."

Studies on proteins have shown age-related decline in enzyme activities, age-related accumulation of oxidized proteins and a decline of the proteolytic machinery of the cell. The proteasome, a highly regulated intracellular proteolytic system, is the major enzymatic system responsible for the degradation of damaged proteins. The current knowledge on regulation and of the properties of this unique proteolytic system with special emphasis to the aging process are discussed in this review. Since it is known that caloric restriction (CR) is the only method to delay the aging process and extend the maximal lifespan the effects of CR on the age-related decline in protein degradation is highlighted."

Prolonged calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to extend both the median and maximal lifespan in a variety of lower species such as yeast, worms, fish, rats, and mice. Mechanisms of this CR-mediated lifespan extension are not fully elucidated, but possibly involve significant alterations in energy metabolism, oxidative damage, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and functional changes in both the neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous systems. Here we review some of the major physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes after 6 months of CR in overweight otherwise healthy volunteers. Special emphasis is given to the first completed clinical studies that have investigated the effects of controlled, high-quality energy-restricted diets on both biomarkers of longevity and on the development of chronic diseases related to age in humans. With the incremental expansion of research endeavors in the area of energy or caloric restriction, data on the effects of CR in animal models and human subjects are becoming more accessible."

Recent research has provided solid ground to the concept that limiting calorie intake slows down brain aging and protects from age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The present review summarizes the most relevant among these data and highlights some genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for caloric restriction-related neuroprotection. To understand these mechanisms is important because this information makes them potential targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at reproducing the metabolic, genetic and molecular features responsible for the beneficial effect of caloric restriction. Most promising among these targets are neurotrophins, such as BDNF, transcription factors, such as FoxO and PPAR, anti-aging proteins, such as sirtuins, and caloric restriction mimetics acting on oxidative stress and energy metabolism. Notwithstanding the complexity of any therapeutic strategy aimed at reproducing the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, due to multiplicity of the cellular pathways involved in the responses, a great expansion of medicinal chemistry research in this field is expected in the next future."

It has been well documented that oxidative stress is one of the potential causes of aging and age-related NDs. There are no drugs for the treatment of NDs, therefore there is an immediate necessity for the development of strategies/treatments either to prevent or cure age-related NDs. Caloric restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting have been considered as effective strategies in increasing the healthspan and lifespan, but it is difficult to adhere to these routines strictly, which has led to the development of calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs). CRMs are natural compounds that provide similar molecular and biochemical effects of CR, and activate autophagy process. CRMs have been reported to regulate redox signaling by enhancing the antioxidant defense systems through activation of the Nrf2 pathway, and inhibiting ROS generation through attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, CRMs also regulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways to promote neuronal cell survival. Here, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various CRMs at molecular and cellular levels during aging of the brain. The CRMs are envisaged to become a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical arsenal against aging and age-related pathologies."

Reducing nutrition below the amount needed to sustain maximum growth increases longevity in a wide range of organisms. Oxidative damage has been shown to be a major feature of the aging process. Telomere shortening is now well established as a key process regulating cell senescence in vitro. There is some evidence that the same process may be important for aging in vivo. Very recently it has been found that oxidative damage accelerates telomere shortening. It is therefore possible for us to propose as an outline hypothesis that the level of nutrition determines oxidative damage which in turn determines telomere shortening and cell senescence and that this pathway is important in determining aging and longevity in vivo. We also propose that telomeres in addition to their well-recognized role in \"counting\" cell divisions are also, through their GGG sequence, important monitors of oxidative damage over the life span of a cell. This may explain the evolutionary conservations of this triplet in the repeat telomere sequence unit."

Epigenetic information encoded by DNA methylation is tightly regulated, but shows a striking drift associated with age that includes both gains and losses of DNA methylation at various sites. Here, we report that epigenetic drift is conserved across species and the rate of drift correlates with lifespan when comparing mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans. Twenty-two to 30-year-old rhesus monkeys exposed to 30% caloric restriction since 7-14 years of age showed attenuation of age-related methylation drift compared to ad libitum-fed controls such that their blood methylation age appeared 7 years younger than their chronologic age. Even more pronounced effects were seen in 2.7-3.2-year-old mice exposed to 40% caloric restriction starting at 0.3 years of age. The effects of caloric restriction on DNA methylation were detectable across different tissues and correlated with gene expression. We propose that epigenetic drift is a determinant of lifespan in mammals.Caloric restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in mammals. Here, the authors provide evidence that age-related methylation drift correlates with lifespan and that caloric restriction in mice and rhesus monkeys results in attenuation of age-related methylation drift."

Many aging-associated mechanisms are nutrient responsive, but despite the ubiquitous functions of these pathways, the benefits of DR often vary among individuals and even among tissues within an individual, challenging the aging research field. Furthermore, it is often assumed that lifespan interventions like DR will also extend healthspan, which is thus often ignored in aging studies. In this review, we provide an overview of DR as an intervention and discuss the mechanisms by which it affects lifespan and various healthspan measures. We also review studies that demonstrate exceptions to the standing paradigm of DR being beneficial, thus raising new questions that future studies must address. We detail critical factors for the proposed field of precision nutrigeroscience, which would utilize individualized treatments and predict outcomes using biomarkers based on genotype, sex, tissue, and age."

Fasting consists of the catabolism of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to maintain blood glucose levels in a normal range. The action mechanisms of fasting were firstly understood in minor organisms and later in humans. Nutritional interventions of caloric restriction could attenuate age-associated epigenetic alterations and could have a protective effect against cellular alterations, promoting longevity and health span. While most fasting studies point out the weight and fat mass decreases, it is important to define specific guidelines for fasting and non-fasting days to enhance adherence, minimize the dropout rates of the interventions, and maximize body composition improvement. Although the panorama of evidence on fasting and caloric restriction is wide, there is a lack of a safe fasting protocol to guide physicians in its prescription. The main goal is to identify a how to use guide, a major posology of fasting, inserted within a huge dietetic personalized strategy leading to an optimal and healthy nutritional status."

At the same time, there is a measurable decrease in the volume of adipose tissue, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, accompanied by modifications of lipid and energy metabolism and increased resistance to endogenous and extraneous stress. The metabolic changes induced by dietary restriction, the inhibition of fat deposition in nonadipose tissue and the effects on signal transduction are considered the most likely candidates for mechanisms underlying the effects of CR."

A recent cross-taxa meta-analysis found that, depending upon circumstance, average longevity may be increased or decreased by early-life dietary restriction. Unstudied are the effects of diet during development on among-individual variance in longevity. Here, we address this issue using emerging methods for meta-analysis of variance. We found that, in general, standard deviation (s.d.) in longevity is around 8% higher under early-life dietary restriction than a standard diet. The effects became especially profound when dietary insults were experienced prenatally (s.d. increased by 29%) and/or extended into adulthood (s.d. increased by 36.6%). Early-life dietary restriction may generate variance in longevity as a result of increased variance in resource acquisition or allocation, but the mechanisms underlying these largely overlooked patterns clearly warrant elucidation."

Increasing evidence suggests that caloric restriction extends longevity and retards age-related diseases at least in part by reducing metabolic rate and oxidative stress in a variety of species, including yeast, worms, flies, and mice. Moreover, recent studies in invertebrates - worms and flies, highlight the intricate interrelation between reproductive longevity and somatic aging (known as disposable soma theory of aging), which appears to be conserved in vertebrates. This review is specifically focused on how the reproductive system modulates somatic aging and vice versa in genetic model systems. Since many signaling pathways governing the aging process are evolutionarily conserved, similar mechanisms may be involved in controlling soma and reproductive aging in vertebrates.

Studies in different animal species indicate that reducing food intake (\"caloric restriction\" [CR]) can increase lifespan and delay the onset of diseases and the biological hallmarks of aging. Obesity has been described as \"accelerated aging\" and therefore the lifespan and health benefits generated by CR in both aging and obesity may occur via similar mechanisms. Beyond calorie intake, studies based on nutritional geometry have shown that protein intake and the interaction between dietary protein and carbohydrates influence age-related health and lifespan. Studies where animals are calorically restricted by providing free access to diluted diets have had less impact on lifespan than those studies where animals are given a reduced aliquot of food each day and are fasting between meals. This has drawn attention to the role of fasting in health and aging, and exploration of the health effects of various fasting regimes. Although definitive human clinical trials of nutrition and aging would need to be unfeasibly long and unrealistically controlled, there is good evidence from animal experiments that some nutritional interventions based on CR, manipulating dietary macronutrients, and fasting can influence aging biology and lifespan."

Whereas the relationship between Sirt-1 and CR is clear, the molecular mechanisms by which Sir2 increases longevity are still unknown. In mammals, CR induces physiological and behavioral changes, and many studies have shown that CR decreases production of reactive oxygen species production thus minimizing oxidative damage, leading to the hypothesis that CR by reducing oxidative stress extends the lifespan by counteraction of aging. In fact, the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases involves oxidative stress as an early stage in its development. Recently we found that in aged rats the SIRT1 activity was decreased in heart and adipose tissue, showing as aging is characterized in vivo by a reduced efficiency of this key-regulator of longevity. Whereas several studies have reported that increased physical activity can improve mean life span presumably by reducing mortality risk from many age-related diseases, exercise and longevity studies have failed to document an exercise effect on maximum life span. However, in aged rats a moderate prolonged exercise training is able to induce increase in SIRT1 activity, suggesting that this tool could counteract age-related dysfunctions."

This paper discusses how Clive Maine McCay, a professor of animal husbandry at Cornell University, began his investigation of the topic and promoted it as a productive research program in the multidisciplinary science of gerontology. Initially, McCay observed the effect of reduced-calorie diets on life span and senescence while pursuing his nutrition research in the context of animal husbandry and agriculture. But when he received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and started to participate in the establishment of gerontology during the 1930s, the scope of his research was considerably expanded beyond his original disciplinary domain. It became a multidisciplinary research program that attracted scholars from a variety of scientific and medical disciplines. This paper argues that through this expansion McCay's research created a means of maintaining cooperation among the diverse and heterogeneous academic fields constituting gerontology."

Calorie restriction (CR) and more recently rapamycin (rapa) feeding have both been used to extend lifespan in mice. Preciously few studies have actually investigated the impact of each of these interventions upon in vivo immune defense against relevant microbial challenge in old organisms. We tested how rapa and CR each impacted the immune system in adult and old mice. We report that each intervention differentially altered T-cell development in the thymus, peripheral T-cell maintenance, T-cell function and host survival after West Nile virus infection, inducing distinct but deleterious consequences to the aging immune system. We conclude that neither rapa feeding nor CR, in the current form/administration regimen, may be optimal strategies for extending healthy immune function and, with it, lifespan."

Cardiovascular aging in humans is characterized by structural pathologic remodeling including cardiac and vascular fibrosis, hypertrophy, stiffness, micro- and macro-circulatory impairment, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction precipitating heart failure with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction, and cardiovascular cell death. Cellular senescence, an important hallmark of aging, is a critical factor that impairs repair and regeneration of damaged cells in cardiovascular tissues whereas autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process is an essential inherent mechanism that removes senescent cells throughout life time in all tissues. Several recent reviews have highlighted the fact that all longevity treatment paradigms to mitigate progression of aging-related pathologies converge in induction of autophagy, activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin pathway, and inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). These longevity treatments include health style changes such as caloric restriction, and drug treatments using rapamycin, the first FDA-approved longevity drug, as well as other experimental longevity drugs such as metformin, rapamycin, aspirin, and resveratrol. However, in the heart tissue, autophagy induction has to be tightly regulated since evidence show excessive autophagy results in cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Here we discuss emerging evidence for microRNA-mediated tight regulation of autophagy in the heart in response to treatment with rapamycin, and novel approaches to monitor autophagy progression in a temporal manner to diagnose and regulate autophagy induction by longevity treatments."

A significant number of studies have subsequently shown that restricting total protein, branched chain amino acids or individual amino acids in the diet, as well as ketogenic diets, can elicit similar effects. In addition, it is becoming clear that fasting protocols, such as time-restricted-feeding or every-other-day feeding, without changes in overall energy intake can also profoundly affect rodent longevity and late-life health. In this review, I will provide a historical perspective on various dietary interventions that modulate ageing in rodents and discuss how this understanding of the dietary exposome may help identify future strategies to maintain late-life health and wellbeing in humans."

Fifty-eight neotenic traits have been described by now in the naked mole rat at the organismal, tissue, cellular, and metabolism levels. Among them, there are traits that increase the lifespan, including mild depolarization of mitochondria that prevents generation by these organelles of reactive oxygen species known to strongly promote aging. Mild mitochondrial depolarization disappears with age in short-lived mammals (mouse Mus musculus) much faster than in long-lived mammals (e.g., naked mole rats and bats). The development of neoteny in naked mole rats has been due to the social organization. These animals live in subterranean colonies, where sexual reproduction is monopolized by the queen and one or several males who are defended and provided with nutrition by numerous subordinates. Humans have achieved a gradual increase in the lifespan first due to neoteny, and then to the technical progress, which can be observed by comparing the lifespan curves of chimpanzees, hunter-gatherers of the Paraguayan Ache tribe, and residents of Sweden from the XVII century to the present day. Significantly different rates of neoteny and technical progress make it possible to discriminate between the contributions of these two longevity mechanisms."

Studies of caloric restriction in non-human primates and in humans are ongoing and initial results suggest prolongation of life as well as prevention of age-related disease. There is also data in rodents suggesting that short term caloric restriction has beneficial effects on fertility.

However, the effects of DR regimens on longevity remain controversial, as some studies have demonstrated that IF, rather than CR or diet composition, influences longevity, while other studies have shown that the restricted-carbohydrate or -protein diets, rather than CR, determine health and longevity. Many factors, including DR-related factors (carbohydrate or protein composition, degree and duration of DR), and individual differences (health status, sex, genotype, and age of starting DR), would be used to explain the controversial anti-aging effects of DR, thus highlighting the necessity of precise DR intervention for anti-aging. Personalized DR intervention in humans is challenging because of the lack of accurate aging molecular biomarkers and vast individual variability. Using machine learning to build a predictive model based on the data set of clinical features, gut microbiome and metabolome, may be a good method to achieve precise DR intervention. Therefore, this review analyzed the anti-aging effects of various DR regimens, summarized their mechanisms and influencing factors, and proposed a future research direction for achieving personalized DR regimens for slowing aging."

Research aimed at understanding the mechanism by which CR slows aging has focused heavily on insulin and downstream signaling cascades. Glucagon, a hormone that counter-regulates insulin, is commonly affected by these same interventions. To investigate the role of glucagon in aging, we used dietary manipulation, global and liver-specific glucagon receptor knockout, and pharmacological glucagon receptor activation. We found that globally eliminating glucagon receptor signaling (Gcgr KO) decreases median lifespan by 35% in lean mice. Extending these findings to metabolic health, we found that glucagon receptor signaling is indispensable to the metabolic response to chronic CR in young and aged mice. While CR decreased liver fat, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol in WT mice, these metabolic benefits were absent in Gcgr KO mice. In line with these observations, we found that critical nutrient-sensing pathways known to improve aging are dysregulated in mice lacking glucagon receptor signaling at the liver (Gcgr<sup>hep-/-</sup>). Liver-specific deletion of the glucagon receptor decreases hepatic AMP kinase activation in aging mice, regardless of diet. Further, CR decreases hepatic mTOR activity in WT mice but not in Gcgr<sup>hep-/-</sup> mice. Together, these findings propose that glucagon signaling plays a critical role in both normal aging and the lifespan and healthspan extension driven by caloric restriction."

Conversely, weight loss strategies, particularly caloric restriction, have shown promise in improving health status in patients with HFpEF and are considered the gold standard for promoting longevity and healthspan (disease-free lifetime) in model organisms. In this review, we implicate fundamental mechanisms of aging in driving HFpEF and elucidate how caloric restriction mitigates the disease progression. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for pharmacologically mimicking the beneficial effects of caloric restriction in HFpEF using clinically approved and emerging caloric restriction mimetics. We surmise that these compounds could offer novel therapeutic avenues for HFpEF and alleviate the challenges associated with the implementation of caloric restriction and other lifestyle modifications to reduce the burden of HFpEF at a population level."

Such studies in insects and mice indicate that animals with ad libitum access to low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets have longest lifespans.

With current knowledge of stem cells, it is feasible to design and test interventions that delay aging and improve both health and lifespan. Stem cells, together with anti-aging genes such as Klotho, play a crucial role in delaying the aging process. Stem cells in combination with anti-aging genes make a complex and protective shield, which stand against the eroding effects of aging. Increased wear and tear of the stem cells, as well as Klotho deficiency, is expected to heavily increase cellular damage and accelerate the process of aging. Stem cells in conjugation with anti-aging genes probably receive and neutralize most of the devastating signaling effects which are known to cause premature aging. The shield of stem cells combined with anti-aging genes is a primary target for absorbing the shock of aging. If this shield neutralizes the shocks, it could lead to a youthful state, but if not it will accelerate the aging journey. In this review, we concisely discuss the neutralizing ability, operated and regulated by stem cells and other life-extension factors. We suggest that stem cell interventions that increase rejuvenation and keep in balance the expression of anti-aging genes could delay the aging phenotypes and result in prolonged lifespan."

In free living creatures, maintaining health and function into old age requires resilience against a multitude of stressors. Conversely, in experimental settings, conventional housing of rodents limits exposure to such challenges, thereby obscuring an accurate assessment of resilience. Caloric restriction (CR) and exercise, as well as pharmacologic strategies (resveratrol, rapamycin, metformin, senolytics), are well established to improve indices of health and aging, but some paradoxical effects have been observed on resilience. For instance, CR potently retards the onset of age-related diseases, and improves lifespan to a greater extent than exercise in a variety of models. However, exercise has proven more consistently beneficial to organismal resilience against a broad array of stressors, including infections, surgery, wound healing and frailty. CR can improve cellular stress defenses and protect from frailty, but also impairs the response to infections, bed rest and healing. How an intervention will impact not only longevity, health and function, but also resiliency, is critical to better understanding translational implications. Thus, organismal robustness represents a critical, albeit understudied aspect of aging, which needs more careful attention in order to better inform on how putative age-delaying strategies will impact preservation of health and function in response to stressors with aging in humans."

Here, we evaluate maternal age effects on offspring lifespan, reproduction, and the response to caloric restriction, and investigate maternal investment as a source of maternal age effects using the rotifer, Brachionus manjavacas, an aquatic invertebrate. We found that offspring lifespan and fecundity decline with increasing maternal age. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in all offspring, but the magnitude of lifespan extension is greater in the offspring from older mothers. The trade-off between reproduction and lifespan extension under low food conditions expected by life history theory is observed in young-mother offspring, but not in old-mother offspring. Age-related changes in maternal resource allocation to reproduction do not drive changes in offspring fitness or plasticity under caloric restriction in B. manjavacas. Our results suggest that the declines in reproduction in old-mother offspring negate the evolutionary fitness benefits of lifespan extension under caloric restriction."

This is particularly true for the feeding of dogs. If we are indeed concerned with the feeding of the geriatric dog, we must begin to emphasize changes in nutritional practices that go back to the period preceding birth. Unrestricted caloric intake of dogs during periods of growth and development, even when in proper balance with intake of essential nutrients, has been shown to accelerate somatic processes, resulting in delayed maturation of cartilage and excessive bone apposition. This was followed by reduced bone resorption and remodeling. These processes were associated with the development of either earlier or more severe degenerative diseases of the skeletal system. Studies with rodents have demonstrated damaging effects of unrestricted dietary intake on longevity itself. Most damaging have been the decreasing efficiency of cellular immunity and corresponding increases in autoimmune responses during later life. Judicious caloric restriction beginning even in adult life can have a rejuvenating effect on immune response capacity. Regardless of age, a controlled nutrient intake seems the order of the day. Returning to Lucretius, the graves are indeed being dug with teeth."

Microbes, dead or alive, phenocopy dietary protein, and the calculated dependence on microbial protein content is similar to the protein requirements determined from fly feeding studies, suggesting that microbes enhance host protein nutrition by serving as protein-rich food. Microbes that enhance larval growth are also associated with the ability to better thrive on fly culture medium. Our results suggest an unanticipated range of microbial species that promote fly development and longevity and highlight microbial quantity as an important determinant of effects on physiology and lifespan during undernutrition."

These regulators including leptin, insulin, and ghrelin, modulate the orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptide expression in hypothalamic nuclei. The anti-aging effects of caloric restriction have been explained from an evolutional viewpoint of the adaptive response of the neuroendocrine and metabolic response systems to maximize survival during periods of food shortage. In organisms, excess energy is stored in adipose tissues as a triglyceride preparation for such survival situations. Adipose tissue has recently been recognized as an endocrine organ, and leptin, as secreted by adipocyte, seems to be an especially important factor for the adaptive response to fasting and neuroendocrine alterations under caloric restriction. In this review, we discuss the potential involvement of neuroendocrine modulators in longevity and the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction."

The greatest risk factor for neurodegeneration is age; thus, the antiaging effects of CR might attenuate progressive cell death and avert the aggregation of abnormal proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. CR is a potent inducer of autophagy, a tightly regulated intracellular process that facilitates recycling of abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles into bioenergetic and biosynthetic materials to maintain homeostasis. Thus, dysregulated autophagy can lead to cellular dysfunction, abnormal protein accumulation, proteotoxicity and subsequently the onset of several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the targeted and precision-controlled activation of autophagy represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions that delay aging by modulating specific stages of autophagy might be beneficial against premature aging, neurodegeneration and its associated ailments. However, the dynamic and often compensatory cross-talk that exists between the protein degradation pathways makes clinical translational approaches challenging. Here we review the primary autophagy pathways in the context of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on compensatory mechanisms and pathway failure. By critically assessing each underlying molecular machinery, we reveal their impact on aging and unmask the role of caloric restriction in changing cellular fate by delayed aging through stimulation of autophagy. This may point towards novel and better targeted interventions that exploit the autophagic machinery in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

For over 70 yr, caloric restriction has been studied, and during the last years the number of investigations on such nutritional intervention and aging has dramatically increased. Because caloric restriction decreases the aging rate, it constitutes an excellent approach to better understand the mechanisms underlying the aging process. Various investigations have reported reductions in steady-state oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA in animals subjected to restricted caloric intake. Most interestingly, several investigations have reported that these decreases in oxidative damage are related to a lowering of mitochondrial free radical generation rate in various tissues of the restricted animals. Thus, similar to what has been described for long-lived animals in comparative studies, a decrease in mitochondrial free radical generation has been suggested to be one of the main determinants of the extended life span observed in restricted animals. In this study we review recent reports of caloric restriction and longevity, focusing on mitochondrial oxidative stress and the proposed mechanisms leading to an extended longevity in calorie-restricted animals."

Recent advances in nutritional research, notably the development of state-space geometric models, the Geometric Framework (GF), offer new opportunities to disentangle the effects of calories and nutrients. We begin by introducing these models, then set out the four questions that must be addressed to establish the relationship between nutrition and aging and indicate how the GF might help in answering these. We next provide an exemplar experimental protocol and consider some practical challenges to implementing the GF. Our conclusion is that Drosophila provides the most suitable system for an initial study."

Indeed, it has been proven that caloric restriction prevents age-related neuronal damage. What are those mechanisms involved in the effects of caloric restriction on brain functioning? Could caloric restriction be proposed in the future to prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease? Is there a future for caloric restriction interventions in adults? RECENT FINDINGS: Hypotheses linking caloric restriction to cognitive capability include anti-inflammatory mechanisms, reduction of neural oxidative stress, promotion of synaptic plasticity, induction of various stress and neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors. Caloric restriction may also prevent beta-amyloid neuropathology in Alzheimer transgenic models. Finally, both exercise and caloric restriction enhance neurogenesis via different mechanisms suggesting that their combination may decrease the risk of neurodegenerative disease. SUMMARY: It is now well established that caloric restriction could be used to promote successful brain aging. Data from randomized controlled trials in humans are limited. No positive effect on cognitive impairment was found probably due to methodological limitations. The long-term effects of caloric restriction in adults must be clarified before engaging in such preventive strategy. Additional animal studies must be conducted in the future to test the effects of 'multidomain' interventions (caloric restriction plus regular exercise) on age-related cognitive decline."

These interventions generally have a stronger effect in males than in females. Using Jonckheere's trend test to associate increased average lifespans with metabolic changes for each sex, we found sexual dimorphism in metabolism of plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, kidney, and inguinal fat. Plasma showed the strongest trend of differentially expressed compounds, highlighting potential benefits of plasma in tracking healthy aging. Using chemical set enrichment analysis, we found that the majority of these affected compounds were lipids, particularly in male tissues, in addition to significant differences in trends for amino acids, which were particularly apparent in the kidney. We also found strong metabolomic effects in adipose tissues. Inguinal fat exhibited surprising increases in neutral lipids with polyunsaturated side chains in male mice. In female mice, gonadal fat showed trends proportional to lifespan extension effect across multiple lipid classes, particularly phospholipids. Interestingly, for most tissues, we found similar changes induced by lifespan-extending interventions to metabolomic differences between untreated 12-month-old mice and 4-month-old mice. This finding implies that lifespan-extending treatments tend to reverse metabolic phenotypes to a biologically younger stage."

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is recognized as the most important negative regulator of autophagy, is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of mTOR and its dependent autophagy in normal brain during aging remains unknown. Furthermore, caloric restriction (CR) is frequently used as a tool to study mechanisms behind aging and age-associated diseases because CR can prevent age-related diseases and prolong lifespan in several model organisms. Inhibiting mTOR and promoting autophagy activity play roles in aging delayed by CR. However, whether CR can ameliorate age-related cognition deficits by inhibiting mTOR and activate autophagy in hippocampus needs to be further investigated. Here we showed a decline of autophagic degradation in mice hippocampus in correlation with age-dependent cognitive dysfunction, whereas the activity of mTOR and its upstream brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling was decreased with aging. In addition, facilitating the mTOR pathway successfully declines and sustains autophagic degradation with aging in hippocampus by CR treatment and is involved in CR by ameliorating age-related cognitive deficits."

Caloric restriction (CR) has similar effects on healthspan and lifespan, and causes an extension of longevity in Ames dwarf mice. Our study objective was to determine whether Ames dwarfism or CR influence neuromusculoskeletal function in middle-aged (82 ± 12 weeks old) or old (128 ± 14 w.o.) mice. At the examined ages, strength was improved by dwarfism, CR, and dwarfism plus CR in male mice; balance/ motor coordination was improved by CR in old animals and in middle-aged females; and agility/ motor coordination was improved by a combination of dwarfism and CR in both genders of middle-aged mice and in old females. Therefore, extension of longevity by congenital hypopituitarism is associated with improved maintenance of the examined measures of strength, agility, and motor coordination, key elements of frailty during human aging, into advanced age. This study serves as a particularly important example of knowledge related to addressing aging-associated diseases and disorders that results from studies in long-lived mammals."

In this study, we show that transgenic expression of Sirtuin-1 induces autophagy in human cells in vitro and in Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo. The knockdown or knockout of Sirtuin-1 prevented the induction of autophagy by resveratrol and by nutrient deprivation in human cells as well as by dietary restriction in C. elegans. Conversely, Sirtuin-1 was not required for the induction of autophagy by rapamycin or p53 inhibition, neither in human cells nor in C. elegans. The knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of Sirtuin-1 enhanced the vulnerability of human cells to metabolic stress, unless they were stimulated to undergo autophagy by treatment with rapamycin or p53 inhibition. Along similar lines, resveratrol and dietary restriction only prolonged the lifespan of autophagy-proficient nematodes, whereas these beneficial effects on longevity were abolished by the knockdown of the essential autophagic modulator Beclin-1. We conclude that autophagy is universally required for the lifespan-prolonging effects of caloric restriction and pharmacological Sirtuin-1 activators."

            "abstract": "Caloric restriction promotes longevity in multiple animal models. Compounds modulating nutrient-sensing pathways have been suggested to reproduce part of the beneficial effect of caloric restriction on aging. However, none of the commonly studied caloric restriction mimetics actually produce a decrease in calories. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) are a class of drugs which lower glucose by promoting its elimination through urine, thus inducing a net loss of calories. This effect promotes a metabolic shift at the systemic level, fostering ketones and fatty acids utilization as glucose-alternative substrates, and is accompanied by a modulation of major nutrient-sensing pathways held to drive aging, e.g., mTOR and the inflammasome, overall resembling major features of caloric restriction. In addition, preliminary experimental data suggest that SGLT-2i might also have intrinsic activities independent of their systemic effects, such as the inhibition of cellular senescence. Consistently, evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies have also suggested a marked ability of SGLT-2i to ameliorate low-grade inflammation in humans, a relevant driver of aging commonly referred to as inflammaging. Considering also the amount of data from clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses suggesting a tangible effect on age-related outcomes, such as cardiovascular diseases, heart failure, kidney disease, and all-cause mortality also in patients without diabetes, here we propose a framework where at least part of the benefit provided by SGLT-2i is mediated by their ability to blunt the drivers of aging. To support this postulate, we synthesize available data relative to the effect of this class on: 1- animal models of healthspan and lifespan; 2- selected molecular pillars of aging in preclinical models; 3- biomarkers of aging and especially inflammaging in humans; and 4- COVID-19-related outcomes. The burden of evidence might prompt the design of studies testing the potential employment of this class as anti-aging drugs."

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that insulin receptor substrate molecules are implicated downstream of insulin and IGF receptors in the extension of lifespan. We showed recently that early postnatal diet plays a significant role in the development of the somatotropic axis, and that part of the neuroendocrine plasticity of growth hormone secretion depends on postnatal nutrition. We also showed that the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies varied with the development of somatotropic function. Neuroendocrine pathways are also prime targets for pharmacological treatments, and administration of rapamycin to adult mice has indeed recently been reported to prolong lifespan in mice. With respect to human aging, new studies identified several genes of the somatotropic axis as longevity determinants, and a recent study shows that variants of FOXO3A, downstream signaling molecule in the insulin/IGF pathway, are associated with extreme longevity in humans. Finally, several functional mutations of the human IGF-IR have been discovered in centenarians."

Frailty is one such measure that is tightly correlated with human aging. Several frailty measures have been developed that focus on phenotypes of aging, including physical, cognitive and metabolic health that define healthspan. The extent at which cumulative deficits associated with frailty predict functional characteristics of healthy aging and longevity is currently unknown. A growing consensus for the use of animal models has emerged to evaluate a composite measure of frailty that provides a translational basis to understanding human frailty. In this review, we will focus on the impact of several anti-aging interventions, some of which have been characterized as caloric restriction (CR) mimetics such as metformin, rapamycin, and resveratrol as well as more novel approaches that are emerging in the field - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors, small molecule activators of sirtuins, and senolytics - on a number of frailty measurements associated with aging-related outcomes in mice and discuss the translatability of such measures to human frailty."

Understanding epigenetics is of high importance because of the concept that external factors such as nutrition and diet may possess the ability to alter gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence. The ED introduces bioactive medicinal chemistry compounds such as sulforaphane (SFN), curcumin (CCM), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol (RSV) that are thought to aid in extending the human lifespan. CR, although similar to ED in the target of longevity, mildly reduces the total daily calorie intake while concurrently providing all beneficial nutrients. Both CR and ED may act as epigenetic modifiers to slow the aging process through histone modification, DNA methylation, and by modulating microRNA expression. CR and ED have been proposed as two important mechanisms that modulate and potentially slow the progression of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, obesity, Alzheimer's and osteoporosis to name a few. While many investigators have examined CR and ED as separate entities, this review will primarily focus on both as they relate to age-related diseases, their epigenetic effects and their medicinal chemistry."

For the first time in a mammal, to our knowledge, we evaluate the effects of dietary protein (P), carbohydrate (C), fat (F), and energy (E) on lifespan and reproductive function in aging male and female mice. We show that, as in invertebrates, the balance of macronutrients has marked and largely opposing effects on reproductive and longevity outcomes. Mice were provided ad libitum access to one of 25 diets differing in P, C, F, and E content, with reproductive outcomes assessed at 15 months. An optimal balance of macronutrients exists for reproductive function, which, for most measures, differs from the diets that optimize lifespan, and this response differs with sex. Maximal longevity was achieved on diets containing a P:C ratio of 1:13 in males and 1:11 for females. Diets that optimized testes mass and epididymal sperm counts (indicators of gamete production) contained a higher P:C ratio (1:1) than those that maximized lifespan. In females, uterine mass (an indicator of estrogenic activity) was also greatest on high P:C diets (1:1) whereas ovarian follicle number was greatest on P:C 3:1 associated with high-F intakes. By contrast, estrous cycling was more likely in mice on lower P:C (1:8), and the number of corpora lutea, indicative of recent ovulations, was greatest on P:C similar to those supporting greatest longevity (1:11)."

Significant evidence in non-primate animals demonstrates that caloric restriction increases average and maximal life span. However, historically, caloric intake reduction in humans has been involuntary and accompanied by poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and a lack of modern health care. As a result, caloric restriction in people typically has been accompanied by a reduction of both average and maximal life span. Conversely, improvements in standards of living usually are accompanied by an increased food supply and resultant improved health and longevity. The majority of the world is now in a new era where an abundance of caloric intake and its associated obesity are causing widespread chronic illness and premature death. What would happen if one were to institute caloric restriction with high-quality nutrition within an environment of modern sanitation and health care? This review argues that improved health and improved average life span would quite likely result. A lengthening of maximal human life span with this combination is perhaps possible but by no means certain."

Aging is characterized by increased risks for metabolic disorders, with age-associated degenerative diseases exhibiting varying degrees of mitochondrial dysfunction. The traditional view of the role of mitochondria generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular aging, assumed to be causative and simply detrimental for a long time now, is in need of reassessment. While there is little doubt that high levels of ROS are detrimental, mounting evidence points toward a lifespan extension effect exerted by mild to moderate ROS elevation. Dietary caloric restriction, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-I signaling, and inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin are robust longevity-promoting interventions. All of these appear to elicit mitochondrial retrograde signaling processes (defined as signaling from the mitochondria to the rest of the cell, for example, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, or UPR(mt)). The effects of mitochondrial retrograde signaling may even spread to other cells/tissues in a noncell autonomous manner by yet unidentified signaling mediators. Multiple recent publications support the notion that an evolutionarily conserved, mitochondria-initiated signaling is central to the genetic and epigenetic regulation of cellular aging and organismal lifespan."

One influential hypothesis is the idea that the potential for cell division and replacement are important factors in aging. In this work, we review and discuss this perspective in the context of interventions in mammals that appear to accelerate or retard aging. Rather than focus on molecular mechanisms, we interpret results from an integrative biology perspective of how gene products affect cellular functions, which in turn impact on tissues and organisms. We review evidence suggesting that mutations that give rise to features resembling premature aging tend to be associated with cellular phenotypes such as increased apoptosis or premature replicative senescence. In contrast, many interventions in mice that extend lifespan and might delay aging, including caloric restriction, tend to either hinder apoptosis or result in smaller animals and thus may be the product of fewer cell divisions. Therefore, it appears plausible that changes in the number of times that cells, and particularly stem cells, divide during an organism's lifespan influence longevity and aging. We discuss possible mechanisms related to this hypothesis and propose experimental paradigms."

The diversion of energy and subsequent molecular mechanisms might extend the lifespan. A growing body of evidence indicates that leptin, a peptide hormone secreted from adipocytes, has a key role in neuroendocrine adaptation against life-threatening stress such as fasting. The present review discusses the potential role of leptin in the anti-aging action of CR. Although several alternative signaling pathways might also mediate the anti-aging action of CR, leptin signaling could be a substantial pathway in the CR action. Research on neuroendocrine mechanisms of CR is warranted, because such efforts might provide clues to the regulation of the aging process in humans."

Here, we report that the partial depletion of riboflavin through knockdown of the C. elegans riboflavin transporter 1 (rft-1) promotes metabolic health by reducing intracellular flavin concentrations. Knockdown of rft-1 significantly increases lifespan in a manner dependent upon AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/aak-2, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and FOXO/daf-16. Riboflavin depletion promotes altered energetic and redox states and increases adiposity, independent of lifespan genetic dependencies. Riboflavin-depleted animals also exhibit the activation of caloric restriction reporters without any reduction in caloric intake. Our findings indicate that riboflavin depletion activates an integrated hormetic response that promotes lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans."

We thereby explored the impact of CR in >300 cellular states and 11 brain regions. CR delayed expansion of inflammatory cell populations, preserved neural precursor cells, and broadly reduced the expression of aging-associated genes involved in cellular stress, senescence, inflammation, and DNA damage. CR restored the expression of region-specific genes linked to cognitive function, myelin maintenance, and circadian rhythm.

Here, we describe that MR extends lifespan in two different mouse models of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) by reversing the transcriptome alterations in inflammation and DNA-damage response genes present in this condition. Further, MR improves the lipid profile and changes bile acid levels and conjugation, both in wild-type and in progeroid mice. Notably, treatment with cholic acid improves the health span and lifespan in vivo. These results suggest the existence of a metabolic pathway involved in the longevity extension achieved by MR and support the possibility of dietary interventions for treating progeria."

Several theories have been put forward for aging-associated deterioration in ventricular function, including attenuation of growth hormone (insulin-like growth factors and insulin) signaling, loss of DNA replication and repair, histone acetylation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Recent evidence has depicted a rather unique role of autophagy as another important pathway in the regulation of longevity and senescence. Autophagy is a predominant cytoprotective (rather than self-destructive) process. It carries a prominent role in determination of lifespan. Reduced autophagy has been associated with aging, leading to accumulation of dysfunctional or damaged proteins and organelles. To the contrary, measures such as caloric restriction and exercise may promote autophagy to delay aging and associated comorbidities. Stimulation of autophagy using rapamycin may represent a novel strategy to prolong lifespan and combat aging-associated diseases. Rapamycin regulates autophagy through inhibition of the nutrient-sensing molecule mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Inhibition of mTOR through rapamycin and caloric restriction promotes longevity. The purpose of this review is to recapitulate some of the recent advances in an effort to better understand the interplay between rapamycin-induced autophagy and decelerating cardiovascular aging."

Although well studied at the biochemical level, there are still many unanswered questions about how CR and CR mimetics impact genome function and structure.

An age-related chronology of quiescent and non-quiescent yeast cells within this culture is discussed here. We also describe various hallmarks of quiescent and non-quiescent yeast cells. A complex aging-associated program underlies cellular quiescence in budding yeast. This quiescence program includes a cascade of consecutive cellular events orchestrated by an intricate signaling network. We examine here how caloric restriction, a low-calorie diet that extends lifespan and healthspan in yeast and other eukaryotes, influences the cellular quiescence program in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. One of the main objectives of this review is to stimulate an exploration of the mechanisms that link cellular quiescence to chronological aging of budding yeast. Yeast chronological aging is defined by the length of time during which a yeast cell remains viable after its growth and division are arrested, and it becomes quiescent. We propose a hypothesis on how caloric restriction can slow chronological aging of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> by altering the chronology and properties of quiescent cells. Our hypothesis posits that caloric restriction delays yeast chronological aging by targeting four different processes within quiescent cells."

Mice and flies can shift readily between the control and CR physiological states, even at older ages. Many health benefits are induced by even brief periods of CR in flies, rodents, monkeys, and humans. In humans and nonhuman primates, CR produces most of the physiologic, hematologic, hormonal, and biochemical changes it produces in other animals. In primates, CR provides protection from type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases, immunological decline, malignancy, hepatotoxicity, liver fibrosis and failure, sarcopenia, inflammation, and DNA damage. It also enhances muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, affords neuroprotection; and extends mean and maximum lifespan. CR rapidly induces antineoplastic effects in mice. Most claims of lifespan extension in rodents by drugs or nutrients are confounded by CR effects. Transcription factors and co-activators involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, including SirT1, PGC-1alpha, AMPK and TOR may be involved in the lifespan effects of CR. Paradoxically, low body weight in middle aged and elderly humans is associated with increased mortality. Thus, enhancement of human longevity may require pharmaceutical interventions."

We then show that treating Caenorhabditis elegans with rilmenidine at young and older ages increases lifespan. We also demonstrate that the stress-resilience, health span, and lifespan benefits of rilmenidine treatment in C. elegans are mediated by the I1-imidazoline receptor nish-1, implicating this receptor as a potential longevity target. Consistent with the shared caloric-restriction-mimicking gene signature, supplementing rilmenidine to calorically restricted C. elegans, genetic reduction of TORC1 function, or rapamycin treatment did not further increase lifespan. The rilmenidine-induced longevity required the transcription factors FOXO/DAF-16 and NRF1,2,3/SKN-1. Furthermore, we find that autophagy, but not AMPK signaling, was needed for rilmenidine-induced longevity. Moreover, transcriptional changes similar to caloric restriction were observed in liver and kidney tissues in mice treated with rilmenidine. Together, these results reveal a geroprotective and potential caloric restriction mimetic effect by rilmenidine that warrant fresh lines of inquiry into this compound."

It has broad applicability and extends the life of most species through a retardation of aging. There is considerable interest in the use of CR in humans, and animal studies can potentially tell us about the impacts. In this article we highlight some of the things that animal studies can tell us about CR in humans. Rodent studies indicate that the benefits of CR on lifespan extension are related to the extent of restriction. The benefits of CR, however, decline as the age of onset of treatment is delayed. Modeling these impacts suggests that if a 48-y-old man engaged in 30% CR until his normal life expectancy of 78, he might increase his life expectancy by 2.8 y. Exercise and cold exposure induce similar energy deficits, but animals respond to these energy deficits in different ways that have a minor impact on lifespan. Measurements of animal responses when they cease restriction indicate that prolonged CR does not diminish hunger, even though the animals may have been in long-term energy balance. Neuroendocrine profiles support the idea that animals under CR are continuously hungry. The feasibility of restricting intake in humans for many decades without long-term support is questionable. However, what is unclear from animal studies is whether taking drugs that suppress appetite will generate the same impact on longevity or whether the neuroendocrine correlates of hunger play an integral role in mediating CRs effects."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many prevalent clinical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary, and cardiovascular disease associate with features of premature ageing, such as muscle wasting, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and arteriosclerosis. Studies on various animal models have shown that caloric restriction prolongs lifespan. Studies of animals with unusual long or short life for their body size may also contribute to better understanding of ageing processes. The aim of the present article is to review what we can learn about nutritional modulations and ageing interactions from animal biology. RECENT FINDINGS: Caloric restriction is a powerful intervention that increases longevity in animals ranging from short-lived species, such as worms and flies, to primates. As long-term studies on caloric restriction are not feasible to conduct in humans, much interest has focused on the impact of caloric restriction mimetics, such as resveratrol, on ageing processes. Recent data from studies on the long-lived naked mole rat have provided important novel information on metabolic alterations and antioxidative defense mechanisms that characterize longevity. SUMMARY: Better understanding of the biology of exceptionally long-lived animals will contribute to better understanding of ageing processes and novel interventions to extend lifespan also in humans."

            "abstract": "The process of cellular senescence is rapidly emerging as a modulator of organismal aging and disease. Targeting the development and removal of senescent cells is considered a viable approach to achieving improved organismal healthspan and lifespan. Nutrition and health are intimately linked and an appropriate dietary regimen can greatly impact organismal response to stress and diseases including during aging. With a renewed focus on cellular senescence, emerging studies demonstrate that both primary and secondary nutritional elements such as carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, and probiotics can influence multiple aspects of cellular senescence. The present review describes the recent molecular aspects of cellular senescence-mediated understanding of aging and then studies available evidence of the cellular senescence modulatory attributes of major and minor dietary elements. Underlying pathways and future research directions are deliberated to promote a nutrition-centric approach for targeting cellular senescence and thus improving human health and longevity."

This will be accompanied by an increase in age-related conditions that will strongly impair human health and quality of life. For this reason, aging is a major concern worldwide. Healthy aging depends on a combination of individual genetic factors and external environmental factors. Diet has been proved to be a powerful tool to modulate aging and caloric restriction has emerged as a valuable intervention in this regard. However, many questions about how a controlled caloric restriction intervention affects aging-related processes are still unanswered. Nutrient sensing pathways become deregulated with age and lose effectiveness with age. These pathways are a link between diet and aging. Thus, fully understanding this link is a mandatory step before bringing caloric restriction into practice. MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulators of cellular functions and can be modified by diet. Some microRNAs target genes encoding proteins and enzymes belonging to the nutrient sensing pathways and, therefore, may play key roles in the modulation of the aging process. In this review, we aimed to show the relationship between diet, nutrient sensing pathways and microRNAs in the context of aging."

GHRH knockout mice are remarkably long-lived, exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling. These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of growth hormone. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction, we show that the effects of caloric restriction (CR) and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity.

Recent evidence suggests that both organism's sex and age critically impact the functional state of microglia but <i>in vivo</i> determinants of such state(s) remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed <i>in vivo</i> the sex-specific functional states of microglia in young adult, middle aged and old wild type mice by means of multicolor two-photon imaging, using the microglial Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling and directed process motility as main readouts. Our data revealed the sex-specific differences in microglial Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling at all ages tested, beginning with young adults. Furthermore, for both sexes it showed that during the lifespan the functional state of microglia changes at least twice. Already at middle age the cells are found in the reactive or immune alerted state, characterized by heightened Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling but normal process motility whereas old mice harbor senescent microglia with decreased Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling, and faster but disorganized directed movement of microglial processes. The 6-12 months long caloric restriction (70% of <i>ad libitum</i> food intake) counteracted these aging-induced changes shifting many but not all functional properties of microglia toward a younger phenotype. The improvement of Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling was more pronounced in males. Importantly, even short-term (6-week-long) caloric restriction beginning at old age strongly improved microglial process motility and induced a significant albeit weaker improvement of microglial Ca<sup>2 +</sup> signaling. Together, these data provide first sex-specific <i>in vivo</i> characterization of functional properties of microglia along the lifespan and identify caloric restriction as a potent, cost-effective, and clinically relevant tool for rejuvenation of microglia."

Recent discoveries support the notion that an altered mitochondrial proteome induces mitohormesis. Mitohormesis involves a variety of ROS during several growth stages and extends lifespan in yeast and other organisms. Here we recap recent advances in understanding of ROS as signals that decelerate chronological aging in yeast. We also discuss parallels between yeast and worm hypoxic signaling.

Here we introduce an adapted Pace of Aging method designed to quantify differences between individuals and populations in the speed of aging-related health declines. The adapted Pace of Aging method, implemented in data from the US Health and Retirement Study and English Longitudinal Study of Aging (N=21,463), integrates longitudinal data on blood biomarkers, physical measurements, and functional tests. It reveals stark differences in rates of aging between population subgroups and demonstrates strong and consistent prospective associations with incident morbidity, disability, and mortality.

In CR rodents, glucose influx into tissues is not reduced, as compared with control animals fed ad libitum (AL), although plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin are lower. Gene expression profiles in rodents have suggested that CR promotes gluconeogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis in skeletal muscle. In the liver, CR promotes gluconeogenesis but decreases fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis. In lower organisms such as yeasts and nematodes, incomplete blocks in steps of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signal pathway extend lifespan. The life-prolonging effect of CR in yeasts requires NPT1 and SIR2 genes, both of which relate to sensing energy status and silencing genes. These findings stress the substantial role of energy metabolism on CR. Future studies on metabolic adaptation and gene silencing with regard to lower caloric intake will be warranted to understand the mechanisms of the anti-aging and life-prolonging effects of CR."

Average lifespan has increased over the last centuries, as a consequence of medical and environmental factors, but maximal life span remains unchanged. Extension of maximal life span is currently possible in animal models with measures such as genetic manipulations and caloric restriction (CR). CR appears to prolong life by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage. But ROS formation, which is positively implicated in cellular stress response mechanisms, is a highly regulated process controlled by a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. By sensing the intracellular nutrient and energy status, the functional state of mitochondria, and the concentration of ROS produced in mitochondria, the longevity network regulates life span across species by co-ordinating information flow along its convergent, divergent and multiply branched signaling pathways, including vitagenes which are genes involved in preserving cellular homeostasis during stressful conditions. Vitagenes encode for heat shock proteins (Hsp) Hsp32, Hsp70, the thioredoxin and the sirtuin protein systems. Dietary antioxidants, such as carnosine, carnitines or polyphenols, have recently been demonstrated to be neuroprotective through the activation of hormetic pathways, including vitagenes. The hormetic dose-response, challenges long-standing beliefs about the nature of the dose-response in a lowdose zone, having the potential to affect significantly the design of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials as well as strategies for optimal patient dosing in the treatment of numerous diseases. Given the broad cytoprotective properties of the heat shock response there is now strong interest in discovering and developing pharmacological agents capable of inducing stress responses. In this review we discuss the most current and up to date understanding of the possible signaling mechanisms by which caloric restriction, as well hormetic caloric restriction-mimetics compounds by activating vitagenes can enhance defensive systems involved in bioenergetic and stress resistance homeostasis with consequent impact on longevity processes."

OBJECTIVE: Since elderly Okinawans exhibit several phenotypic features of CR including low BMI, low prevalence of chronic diseases, and exceptional longevity, we hypothesized that this phenotype may be reflected in candidate biomarkers of human aging. METHODS: We retrospectively estimated adult energy balance across the life course for septuagenarian birth cohorts (born ca 1915-1925) from Okinawa and the U.S. based on archived data. We then compared plasma DHEA, estrogen and testosterone in a sample of community dwelling members from these birth cohorts. RESULTS: Elderly Okinawans had much lower caloric intake than Americans and appeared mildly calorically restricted (10-15%) at younger ages relative to their estimated energy requirements. Okinawans also had significantly higher plasma DHEA, testosterone and estrogen levels as septuagenarians versus non-CR Americans of similar chronological age. CONCLUSION: These cross-sectional data are consistent with the caloric restriction hypothesis in humans and support further longitudinal investigation into biomarkers of human aging and their potential modification by caloric restriction."

Compared to control animals, caloric restriction extended lifespan by 50% (from 6.4 to 9.6 years, median survival), reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss of brain white matter in several brain regions. However, caloric restriction accelerated loss of grey matter throughout much of the cerebrum. Cognitive and behavioural performances were, however, not modulated by caloric restriction. Thus chronic moderate caloric restriction can extend lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but it affects brain grey matter integrity without affecting cognitive performances."

In humans, however, the effects of CR or other life-extending agents have not yet been investigated systematically. Human maximal lifespan is already substantially greater compared to that of closely related primate species. It is therefore possible that humans have acquired genetic mutations that mimic the CR effect. Here, we tested this notion by comparing transcriptome differences between humans and other primates, with the transcriptome changes observed in mice subjected to CR. We show that the human transcriptome state, relative to other primate transcriptomes, does not match that of the CR mice or mice treated with resveratrol, but resembles the transcriptome state of ad libitum fed mice. At the same time, the transcriptome changes induced by CR in mice are enriched among genes showing age-related changes in primates, concentrated in specific expression patterns, and can be linked with specific functional pathways, including insulin signalling, cancer, and the immune response. These findings indicate that the evolution of human longevity was likely independent of CR-induced lifespan extension mechanisms. Consequently, application of CR or CR-mimicking agents may yet offer a promising direction for the extension of healthy human lifespan."

It is less clear, however, whether CR has a similar effect in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, an area important for learning and memory processes that often are compromised in aging. In order to evaluate the effect of CR on synapses across lifespan, we quantified synapses stereologically in the middle molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) of young, middle aged and old Fischer 344 x Brown Norway rats fed ad libitum (AL) or a CR diet from 4 months of age. The results indicate that synapses are maintained across lifespan in both AL and CR rats. In light of this stability, we addressed whether aging and CR influence neurotransmitter receptor levels by measuring subunits of NMDA (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) and AMPA (GluR1, GluR2) receptors in the DG of a second cohort of AL and CR rats across lifespan. The results reveal that the NR1 and GluR1 subunits decline with age in AL, but not CR rats. The absence of an aging-related decline in these subunits in CR rats, however, does not arise from increased levels in old CR rats. Instead, it is due to subunit decreases in young CR rats to levels that are sustained in CR rats throughout lifespan, but that are reached in AL rats only in old age."

The expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is one of the main determinants of translational rate, and epigenetic modifications finely contribute to its regulation. Previous reports suggest that hypermethylation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus occurs with aging, although with some species- and tissue- specificity. In the present study, we experimentally measured DNA methylation of three regions (the promoter, the 5' of the 18S and the 5' of 28S sequences) in the rDNA locus in liver tissues from rats at two, four, 10, and 18 months. We confirm previous findings, showing age-related hypermethylation, and describe, for the first time, that this gain in methylation also occurs in human hepatocytes. Furthermore, we show that age-related hypermethylation is enhanced in livers of rat upon CR at two and 10 months, and that at two months a trend towards the reduction of rRNA expression occurs. Collectively, our results suggest that CR modulates age-related regulation of methylation at the rDNA locus, thus providing an epigenetic readout of the pro-longevity effects of CR."

            "abstract": "Caloric restriction prolongs the lifespan of many species. Therefore, investigators have researched the usefulness of caloric restriction for healthy lifespan extension. Sirt1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, was identified as a molecule necessary for caloric restriction-related anti-aging strategies. Sirt1 functions as an intracellular energy sensor to detect the concentration of NAD(+), and controls in vivo metabolic changes under caloric restriction and starvation through its deacetylase activity to many targets including histones, nuclear transcriptional factors, and enzymes. During the past decade, investigators have reported the relationship between disturbance of Sirt1 activation and the onset of aging- and obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, a calorie restriction-mimetic action of Sirt1 is now expected as a new therapy for these diseases. In addition, recent studies have gradually clarified the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease. Its activation may also become a new target of treatment in the patients with chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy. In this article, we would like to review the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease based on previous studies, and discuss its possibility as the target of treatment in diabetic nephropathy."

The fundamental principles of optimal health and optimal ageing are abstaining from smoking, modest alcohol consumption, regular physical exercise and a diet rich in fish and plants and low in condensed calories, sugar and dairy products. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary supply and production of advanced glycation end products leads to the accumulation of these products in the tissues and is strongly associated with ageing of the vascular endothelium, nervous system, eyes and other vital organs. Telomeres, which are not involved in DNA repair, remain unrepaired and loose with time. A decline in innate and acquired immunity is seen with increasing age and maintenance of low basal immune activity (degree of inflammation) seems important for health and longevity: 'people who are predisposed to weak inflammatory activity may live longer'. SUMMARY: Supplementation with vitamins has little effect on ageing/prevention of chronic diseases, but antiinflammatory molecules like polyphenols are more effective, especially when combined with reduced intake of calorie-condensed foods. The effect of probiotics on ageing needs further exploration. The effects of caloric restriction, proven effective in other species to control aging and prolong lifespan, have not been fully explored in humans."

Results showed an early dinner (7:13 p.m.) and a calorie restriction lapse of 17.5 h between dinner and the following lunch. The frequency of consumption was high for cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes; low for meat, processed meat, and eggs; and negligible for sweets. Subjects were physically active throughout life. Our results support the importance of a daily caloric restriction lapse, hampering nocturnal postprandial stress and optimizing metabolic response, associated with high consumption of plant-based foods and physical activity for the longevity of centenarians from Abruzzo."

Since AMPK is involved in the adaptation to caloric restriction, the role of age-related changes in AMPK activity in both the aging organism and the aging cell is actively investigated in gerontology. Studies on yeast, worms, flies, rodents, and primates have demonstrated an important effect of this regulator on key signalling pathways involved in the aging process. In some cases, researchers conclude that AMPK promotes aging. However, in our opinion, in such cases, we observe a disturbance in the adaptive ability because of the prolonged cell/organism presence in stressful conditions because the functional capacity of any adaptation system is limited. Interestingly, AMPK can regulate metabolic processes in noncell-autonomous manner. The main effects of AMPK activation in the cell are realized in restriction of proliferation and launching autophagy. In tissues of an aging organism, the ability of AMPK to respond to energy deficit decreases; this fact is especially critical for organs that contain postmitotic cells. In this review, we have tried to consider the involvement of AMPK in age-related changes in the cell and in the organism."

It is generally believed that the benefits of DR arise from eating fewer calories (termed caloric restriction, CR). Here we argue that, rather than calories, the key determinant of the relationship between diet and longevity is the balance of protein to non-protein energy ingested. This ratio affects not only lifespan, but also total energy intake, metabolism, immunity and the likelihood of developing obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Among various possible mechanisms linking macronutrient balance to lifespan, the nexus between the TOR and AMPK signaling pathways is emerging as a central coordinator."

We suggest that a greater emphasis on ecology can help to remedy this, by focusing on the interface between biological mechanisms and the environments in which they evolved by natural selection. Among the most salient aspects of the environment relevant to aging is nutrition, and yet in the bulk of aging research nutrition is coarsely represented as dietary restriction or caloric restriction, without consideration for how specific components of diet, beyond \"energy\" (the undifferentiated mix of macronutrients), are driving the observed effects. More recently, it has become clear that specific nutrients (notably amino acids) and interactions among nutrients (i.e., nutritional balance) play important roles in the biology of aging. We show how a method developed in nutritional ecology, called the Geometric Framework for nutrition, can help to understand the nutritional interactions of animals with their environments, by explicitly distinguishing the roles of calories, individual nutrients and nutrient balance. Central to these models are the active regulatory responses that animals use to mediate between variation in the nutritional environment and fitness-related consequences such as lifespan and reproduction. These homeostatic responses provide a guide for researchers that can help to link the biological mechanisms with evolutionary processes in the context of a multi-dimensional nutritional environment."

The 20 genes known to determine yeast life span appear to function in more than one pathway, implicating a variety of physiological processes in yeast longevity. Less attention has been focused on environmental effects on yeast aging. We have examined the role that nutritional status plays in determining yeast life span. Reduction of the glucose concentration in the medium led to an increase in life span and to a delay in appearance of an aging phenotype. The increase in life span was the more extensive the lower the glucose levels. Life extension was also elicited by decreasing the amino acids content of the medium. This suggests that it is the decline in calories and not a particular nutrient that is responsible, in striking similarity to the effect on aging of caloric restriction in mammals. The caloric restriction effect did not require the induction of the retrograde response pathway, which signals the functional status of the mitochondrion and determines longevity. Furthermore, deletion of RTG3, a downstream mediator in this pathway, and caloric restriction had an additive effect, resulting in the largest increase (123%) in longevity described thus far in yeast. Thus, retrograde response and caloric restriction operate along distinct pathways in determining yeast longevity. These pathways may be exclusive, at least in part. This provides evidence for multiple mechanisms of metabolic control in yeast aging. Inasmuch as caloric restriction lowers blood glucose levels, this study raises the possibility that reduced glucose alters aging at the cellular level in mammals."

Its interest is continually growing, particularly for the identification of mechanisms involved in increasing longevity. Unlike studies in invertebrate and rodent models have provided some indication about the mechanisms of the CR, the efficacy of CR as an anti-aging protocol in primates has not yet been fully established. In this review we present the advantages of using non human primates as relevant models to the study of human aging in general and specifically in the context of therapeutic interventions applicable to humans, such as CR. Through the longitudinal findings in the Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus), we stress the importance of primate studies in the context of research on aging and their potential to advance the development of molecules which can mimic the beneficial effects of CR, already observed in some species, without imposing a reduced calorie diet."

We conducted an integrative critical review of caloric restriction (CR), intermittent fasting (IF), and caloric restriction mimetics (CR-mimetics) to compare shared mechanisms, clinical evidence, limitations, and translational potential. Across modalities, CR and IF consistently activate AMP-activated protein kinase and sirtuins, inhibit mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling, and enhance autophagy, aligning with improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, low-grade inflammation, and selected epigenetic aging measures in humans. CR-mimetics, such as metformin, resveratrol, rapamycin, and spermidine, partially reproduce these effects; however, long-term safety and efficacy in healthy populations remain incompletely defined. Methodological constraints-short trial duration, selective samples, intermediate (nonclinical) endpoints, and limited adherence monitoring-impede definitive conclusions on hard outcomes (frailty, disability, hospitalization, mortality). We propose the Active Management of Aging and Longevity (AMAL) model, a three-level biomarker-guided framework that integrates personalized diet, chrono-nutrition, exercise, and the selective use of CR-mimetics, along with digital monitoring and decision support. AMAL emphasizes epigenetic clocks, multi-omics profiling, inflammatory and microbiome metrics, and adaptive protocols to enhance adherence and clinical relevance. Overall, CR, IF, and CR mimetics constitute promising, complementary strategies to modulate biological aging; rigorous long-term trials with standardized biomarkers and clinically meaningful endpoints are needed to enable their scalable implementation."

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies enriched considerably our understanding of the relationship between aging and gene-nutrient interactions that continuously shape our phenotype. Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in mediating between the nutrient inputs and the ensuing phenotypic changes throughout our entire life and seem to be responsible, in part, for the biological changes that occur during aging. Less is known about the epigenetic role that nutrients have in directly influencing longevity and aging. However, recent studies clearly indicated that because nutrition modulates epigenetic events associated with various diseases (e.g., cancer, obesity, and diabetes), there is at least an indirect epigenetic link between nutrition and longevity and, therefore, biologic plausibility to hypothesize the epigenetic role of nutrition in altering longevity. Apart from limited human studies, promising animal studies brought us much closer to understanding how nutrition could have such an impact upon longevity and aging. SUMMARY: Complex epigenetic mechanisms are involved in aging and longevity, directly or indirectly via disease mechanisms. Nutrition has a strong impact upon epigenetic processes and, therefore, holds promise in having important roles in regulating longevity and aging."

            "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition is the only experimental manipulation that has consistently been shown to increase the mean and maximum lifespan of laboratory rodents. It has been suggested that CR extends the longevity of rodents and reduces the incidence of age-related pathological lesions by reducing the levels of DNA damage and mutations that accumulate with age within a cells genome. This hypothesis is attractive because the integrity of the genome is essential to a cell/organism and because it is supported by the observations that both cancer and immunological defects, which increase significantly with age and are delayed by CR, are associated with changes in DNA damage. However, all the evidence supporting the premise that the accumulation of DNA damage/mutations plays a role in aging and CR is correlative, i.e., the anti-aging action of CR-fed rodents is correlated with decreased DNA damage and mutation and increased DNA repair capacity. Therefore, additional experiments are required which employ more accurate assays of the DNA repair pathways as well as genetically engineered animal models to establish the role of specific DNA repair pathways and/or enzymes in the anti-aging action of CR. In this paper, we review the proposed mechanisms of DNA damage/repair while providing insight into current research that may assist in \"unlocking\" the mechanisms behind the life-prolonging effect of CR."

When yeast cells cultured in this medium consume glucose, they undergo cell cycle arrest at a checkpoint in late G1 and differentiate into quiescent and non-quiescent cell populations. Studies of such differentiation have provided insights into mechanisms of yeast chronological aging under conditions of excessive calorie intake. Caloric restriction is an aging-delaying dietary intervention. Here, we assessed how caloric restriction influences the differentiation of chronologically aging yeast cultures into quiescent and non-quiescent cells, and how it affects their properties. We found that caloric restriction extends yeast chronological lifespan via a mechanism linking cellular aging to cell cycle regulation, maintenance of quiescence, entry into a non-quiescent state and survival in this state. Our findings suggest that caloric restriction delays yeast chronological aging by causing specific changes in the following: 1) a checkpoint in G1 for cell cycle arrest and entry into a quiescent state; 2) a growth phase in which high-density quiescent cells are committed to become low-density quiescent cells; 3) the differentiation of low-density quiescent cells into low-density non-quiescent cells; and 4) the conversion of high-density quiescent cells into high-density non-quiescent cells."

Because experimental and control groups differ only by treatment with RU486, confounding results from using flies of different genetic backgrounds are eliminated, making GeneSwitch especially useful in studies of aging. However, the effect of RU486 itself on longevity has not been well characterized, particularly in relation to nutritional states known to affect lifespan. Here, we show that RU486 has dose- and diet-dependent effects on longevity in both sexes. On low nutrient diets, RU486 supplementation reduces total food consumption, perhaps exacerbating undernutrition to shorten life. RU486 also inhibits proboscis extension responses to low nutrient diets, suggesting that RU486 has an aversive taste which leads to decreased food consumption and diminished longevity. RU486 is not detrimental to fly lifespan on high nutrient food, correlating with reduced effects of the drug on palatability and total consumption on rich diets. Our results highlight the critical importance of considering how food palatability and nutrient intake might be altered by dietary or drug manipulations in studies of aging and behavior."

In contrast, our results suggest that CR can act rapidly to begin life and health span extension, and that its rapid genomic effects are closely linked to its health effects. We found that CR begins to extend lifespan and reduce cancer as a cause of death within 8 weeks in older mice, apparently by reducing the rate of tumor growth. Further, 8 weeks of CR progressively reproduces nearly three quarters of the genomic effects of long-term CR (LTCR) in liver. Fewer of the genomic effects of LTCR are rapidly reproduced by the initiation of CR in the heart, but the changes produced are keys to cardiovascular health. Thus, the genomic effects of CR may be established more rapidly in mitotic than in postmitotic tissues. Most of the genomic effects of LTCR dissipate 8 weeks after switching to a control diet. Consistent with these results, others have shown that acute CR rapidly and reversibly reduces the short-term risk of death in Drosophila to that of LTCR treated flies. Further, in late adulthood, acute CR partially or completely reverses age-related alterations of liver, brain and heart proteins. CR also rapidly and reversibly mitigates biomarkers of aging in adult rhesus macaques and humans. These data argue that highly conserved mechanisms for the rapid and reversible enhancement of life- and health-span exist for mitotic and postmitotic tissues."

The precise mechanisms mediating these beneficial effects are still unresolved. Resetting the circadian clock is another intervention that can lead to increased life span and well being, while clock disruption is associated with aging and morbidity. Currently, a large body of evidence links circadian rhythms with metabolism and feeding regimens. In particular, CR, and possibly also IF, can entrain the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain hypothalamus. These findings raise the hypothesis that the beneficial effects exerted by these feeding regimens could be mediated, at least in part, through resetting of the circadian clock, thus leading to synchrony in metabolism and physiology. This hypothesis is reinforced by a transgenic mouse model showing spontaneously reduced eating alongside robust circadian rhythms and increased life span. This review will summarize recent findings concerning the relationships between feeding regimens, circadian rhythms, and metabolism with implications for ageing attenuation and life span extension."

NPY and ghrelin have been shown to be neuroprotective in different brain areas and to induce several physiological modifications similar to those induced by caloric restriction. However, the effect of NPY and ghrelin in autophagy in cortical neurons is currently not known. Using a cell culture of rat cortical neurons we investigate the involvement of NPY and ghrelin in caloric restriction-induced autophagy. We observed that a caloric restriction mimetic cell culture medium stimulates autophagy in rat cortical neurons and NPY or ghrelin receptor antagonists blocked this effect. On the other hand, exogenous NPY or ghrelin stimulate autophagy in rat cortical neurons. Moreover, NPY mediates the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on autophagy in rat cortical neurons. Since autophagy impairment occurs in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, NPY and ghrelin synergistic effect on autophagy stimulation may suggest a new strategy to delay aging process."

The free radical theory has been expanded to the oxidative stress theory, in which mitochondria play a central role in the development of the aging process because of their critical roles in bioenergetics, oxidant production, and regulation of cell death. A decline in cardiac mitochondrial function associated with the accumulation of oxidative damage might be responsible, at least in part, for the decline in cardiac performance with age. In contrast, lifelong caloric restriction can attenuate functional decline with age, delay the onset of morbidity, and extend lifespan in various species. The effect of caloric restriction appears to be related to a reduction in cellular damage induced by reactive oxygen species. There is increasing evidence that sirtuins play an essential role in the reduction of mitochondrial oxidative stress during caloric restriction. We speculate that cardiac sirtuins attenuate the accumulation of oxidative damage associated with age by modifying specific mitochondrial proteins posttranscriptionally. Therefore, the distinct role of each sirtuin in the heart subjected to caloric restriction should be clarified to translate sirtuin biology into clinical practice."

Successful application of this approach has the potential to yield dramatic health, social, and economic benefits. Psora-4 is an inhibitor of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3, that has previously been shown to increase longevity and health span in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our recent discovery that Psora-4 lifespan benefits in C. elegans are synergistic with those of several other lifespan-extending drugs has motivated us to investigate further the mechanism by which Psora-4 extends lifespan. Here, we report that Psora-4 increases the production of free radicals and modulates genes related to stress response and that its effect intersects closely with the target set of caloric restriction (CR) genes, suggesting that it, in part, acts as CR mimetic. This effect may be related to the role of potassium channels in energy metabolism. Our discovery of a potassium channel blocker as a CR mimetic suggests a novel avenue for mimicking CR and extending a healthy lifespan."

We present a comprehensive framework for the statistical analysis of longitudinal activity and behavioral monitoring and their relationship with age-at-death at the individual level, highlighting the importance of advanced methodological approaches in aging research. The focus is on animal models, where continuous monitoring activity in terms of movement, reproduction and behaviors over the entire lifespan is feasible at the individual level. We specifically demonstrate the methodology with data on activity monitoring for Mediterranean fruit flies. Advanced statistical methodologies to explore the interface between activity and age-at-death include functional principal component analysis, concurrent regression, Fréchet regression and point processes. While the focus of this perspective is on relating age-at-death with data on movement, reproduction, behavior and nutrition of Mediterranean fruit flies, the methodology equally pertains to data from other species, including human data."

As a consequence of the ionic unbalance occurring in the tumor microenvironment, TILs enter an adaptive caloric-restricted state, characterized by a decline in nucleocytosolic acetyl CoA levels and induction of autophagy. These events dictate an epigenetic program that drives the acquisition of a stem-cell-like phenotype and ultimately improves antitumor function. These findings open the way to novel anticancer therapies based on the induction of autophagy by pharmacological caloric restriction mimetics."

In addition to delaying normative aging, inhibition of mTORC1 extends the shortened lifespan of yeast, fly, and mouse models with severe mitochondrial disease. Here we tested whether disruption of S6K1 can recapitulate the beneficial effects of mTORC1 inhibition in the Ndufs4 knockout (NKO) mouse model of Leigh Syndrome caused by Complex I deficiency. These NKO mice develop profound neurodegeneration resulting in brain lesions and death around 50-60 days of age. Our results show that liver-specific, as well as whole body, S6K1 deletion modestly prolongs survival and delays onset of neurological symptoms in NKO mice. In contrast, we observed no survival benefit in NKO mice specifically disrupted for S6K1 in neurons or adipocytes. Body weight was reduced in WT mice upon disruption of S6K1 in adipocytes or whole body, but not altered when S6K1 was disrupted only in neurons or liver. Taken together, these data indicate that decreased S6K1 activity in liver is sufficient to delay the neurological and survival defects caused by deficiency of Complex I and suggest that mTOR signaling can modulate mitochondrial disease and metabolism via cell non-autonomous mechanisms."

The beneficial effects of methionine restriction on HGPS could be linked to reduced inflammation, and improved DNA stability, as well as the normalization of lipid and bile acid metabolism. Previous work has established that behavioral, nutritional, pharmacological and genetic manipulations that extend longevity in model organisms are only efficient if they induce increased autophagic flux. Methionine restriction extends lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in an Atg5- and Atg7-dependent fashion, supporting the notion that methionine restriction may indeed mediate its antiaging effects through the induction of macroautophagy/autophagy as well. Based on these findings, we speculate that autophagy might constitute an actionable therapeutic target to treat progeroid syndromes."

Consequently, caloric restriction significantly lowers the intracellular concentrations of methionine, <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine and cysteine. We also noticed that the low-calorie diet, but not the <i>tor1Δ</i> mutation or lithocholic acid, decreases intracellular ATP, increases the ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios, and rises intracellular ADP during chronological aging.

Adipose tissue seems to be a pivotal organ in the aging process and in determination of lifespan. We have recently shown that fat-specific disruption of the insulin receptor gene is sufficient to increase lifespan in FIRKO mice, suggesting that reduced adiposity, even in the presence of normal or increased food intake, can extend lifespan. The model also suggests a special role for the insulin-signaling pathway in adipose tissue in the longevity process. Reduced fat mass has an impact on the duration of life in several other model organisms. In Drosophila, a specific reduction in the fat body through overexpression of forkhead type transcription factor (dFOXO) extends lifespan. Furthermore, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), the mammalian ortholog of the life-extending yeast gene silent information regulator 2 (SIR2), was proposed to be involved in the molecular mechanisms linking lifespan to adipose tissue. In the control of human aging and longevity, one of the striking physiological characteristics identified in centenarians is their greatly increased insulin sensitivity even compared with younger individuals. The effect of reduced adipose tissue mass on lifespan could be due to the prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis."

In order to achieve this, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three experimental groups fed semisynthetic and isoenergetic diets from weaning until death with different dietary fat sources, namely virgin olive, sunflower, or fish oil. An individual follow-up until death of each animal was performed. Incidence, severity, and burden of specific or group (i.e., neoplastic or non-neoplastic proliferative and non-proliferative) of lesions was calculated along with individual's disease and individual organ lesion burden. Most of the histopathological lesions found have been described in previous studies. Neoplasms, and in particular pituitary adenomas followed by brain tumors, were the most prevalent lesions found in the rats and the main cause of death involving both systems. Incidence of brain lesions was associated with age-at-death. Assayed dietary fats did not present differential effects on pathological changes occurring in endocrine and central nervous systems throughout rat lifespan."

The apparent generality of the longevity-increasing effects of CR has prompted speculation that similar results could be obtained in humans. Longevity, however, is not a trait that exists in a vacuum; it evolves as part of a life history and the physiological mechanisms that determine longevity are undoubtedly complex. Longevity is intertwined with reproduction and there is a cost to reproduction. The impact of this cost on longevity can be age-independent or age-dependent. Given the complexity of the physiology underlying reproductive costs and other mechanisms affecting life history, it is difficult to construct a simple model for the relationship between the particulars of the physiology involved and patterns of mortality. Consequently, we develop a hypothesis-neutral model describing the relationship between diet and longevity. Applying this general model to the special case of human longevity and diet indicates that the benefits of caloric restriction in humans would be quantitatively small."

A recent study by Thondamal et al., in the nematode C. elegans has identified one potential link. The authors showed that the steroid signaling pathway, which regulates reproduction, is activated in response to dietary restriction (DR) and is in fact required for DR-induced lifespan extension.(3) Steroid signaling mutants subjected to DR not only failed to undergo lifespan extension but also exhibited altered germline plasticity. Interestingly, the requirement for steroid signaling was bypassed when germline plasticity was restored, suggesting that the DR response is mediated, at least in part, by signals from the germline. In this commentary, I discuss the implications of these findings. Several theories of aging have proposed the existence of an energetic trade-off between reproduction and lifespan,(4,5) but mechanistic details are lacking. I propose that revisiting and dissecting at the molecular level the link between reproduction, nutrition, and lifespan, will lead to a better understanding of the aging process and its connection to reproduction."

In adipocytes, metabolic/molecular reorganization is triggered culminating in the acquirement of a hypertrophic and hypersecretory phenotype that accelerates aging. Conversely, dietary regimens such as caloric restriction or time-controlled fasting endorse mitochondrial functionality and (mt)ROS-mediated signalling, thus promoting geroprotection.

We introduce the dynamical systems theory to capture two general means for promoting longevity-the creation of a stable fixed point in the \"healthy\" state of the cell and the \"dynamic stabilization\" of the system around this healthy state through environmental oscillations. Guided by the model, we investigate how both of these can be experimentally realized by dynamically modulating environmental glucose levels.

Dietary interventions, such as caloric restriction and periodic fasting, have been shown to enhance metabolic health and extend lifespan in preclinical models. However, inter-individual variation in physiological responses to these interventions, which affects their safety and efficacy when translated to humans, remains poorly understood despite being observed in multiple studies. In this study, we implemented intermittent fasting (IF) for two days per week in 10 inbred strains (n = 800 mice) from the Collaborative Cross (CC). The CC is a multiparent recombinant inbred strain panel that offers a diverse collection of reproducible models to study the genetic control of heterogeneous intervention responses. We conducted longitudinal phenotyping to characterize hundreds of traits, including lifespan, in the CC mice. We demonstrate that sex and genetic background induce variable responses to intermittent fasting across multiple physiological outcomes, including metabolic, hematologic, and immunologic health. Effects of IF on lifespan were sex-specific and variable across genetic backgrounds. Thus we establish that response to IF is genetically determined in an animal model with physiological features similar to humans. We compared our findings in the CC with those from a parallel study of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, highlighting common predictors of health and lifespan, as well as key differences between the genetically diverse inbred and outbred models. These findings underscore the importance of genetic factors in dietary intervention responses, offering valuable insights for translating intermittent fasting benefits to human health and longevity."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The present review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of calorie restriction in modulating metabolism and aging. RECENT FINDINGS: There are currently no interventions or gene manipulations that can prevent, stop or reverse the aging process. However, there are a number of interventions that can slow down aging and prolong maximal lifespan up to 60% in experimental animals. Long-term calorie restriction without malnutrition and reduced function mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway are the most robust interventions known to increase maximal lifespan and healthspan in rodents. Although it is currently not known if long-term calorie restriction with adequate nutrition extends maximal lifespan in humans, we do know that long-term calorie restriction without malnutrition results in some of the same metabolic and hormonal adaptations related to longevity in calorie restriction rodents. Moreover, calorie restriction with adequate nutrition protects against obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis, which are leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. SUMMARY: More studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of calorie restriction in humans and to characterize new markers of aging/longevity that can assist clinicians in predicting mortality and morbidity of the general population."

            "abstract": "Although lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions proposed to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that short lifespans in the control group exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Results may be exaggerated due to statistical effects (e.g. regression to the mean) or other factors. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups. To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach particularly suitable for well-characterized inbred and HET3 mice. In our opinion, the level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control median lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this \"900-day rule\" we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies."

This phenomenon is often assumed to be the result of damage caused by reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria. An alternative explanation for the phenomenon is suggested here. The rate of RNA synthesis is dramatically elevated in small mammals and correlates quantitatively with the rate of aging among different mammalian species. The rate of RNA synthesis is reduced by caloric restriction and inhibition of TOR pathway signaling, two perturbations that increase lifespan in multiple metazoan species. From bacteria to man, the transcription of a gene has been found to increase the rate at which it is damaged, and a number of lines of evidence suggest that DNA damage is sufficient to induce multiple symptoms associated with normal aging. Thus, the correlations frequently found between the rate of RNA synthesis and the rate of aging could potentially reflect an important role for transcription-associated DNA damage in the aging process."

The percentage of elderly people, and consequently the incidence of age-related diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, is projected to increase considerably in the coming decades. Findings from model organisms have revealed that aging is a surprisingly plastic process that can be manipulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Here we review a broad range of findings in model organisms, from environmental to genetic manipulations of aging, with a focus on those with underlying gene-environment interactions with potential for drug discovery and development. One well-studied dietary manipulation of aging is caloric restriction, which consists of restricting the food intake of organisms without triggering malnutrition and has been shown to retard aging in model organisms. Caloric restriction is already being used as a paradigm for developing compounds that mimic its life-extension effects and might therefore have therapeutic value. The potential for further advances in this field is immense; hundreds of genes in several pathways have recently emerged as regulators of aging and caloric restriction in model organisms. Some of these genes, such as IGF1R and FOXO3, have also been associated with human longevity in genetic association studies. The parallel emergence of network approaches offers prospects to develop multitarget drugs and combinatorial therapies. Understanding how the environment modulates aging-related genes may lead to human applications and disease therapies through diet, lifestyle, or pharmacological interventions. Unlocking the capacity to manipulate human aging would result in unprecedented health benefits."

The process of their chronological aging begins. At that point, the yeast culture starts to accumulate quiescent and non-quiescent cells. Here, we purified the high- and low-density populations of quiescent and non-quiescent cells from the yeast cultures limited in calorie supply or not. We then employed mass spectrometry-based quantitative lipidomics to assess the aging-associated changes in high- and low-density cells' lipidomes. We found that caloric restriction, a geroprotective dietary intervention, alters the concentrations of many lipid classes through most of the chronological lifespan of the high- and low-density populations of quiescent and non-quiescent cells. Specifically, caloric restriction decreased triacylglycerol, increased free fatty acid, elevated phospholipid and amplified cardiolipin concentrations. Based on these findings, we propose a hypothetical model for a caloric restriction-dependent reorganization of lipid metabolism in budding yeast's quiescent and non-quiescent cells. We also discovered that caloric restriction creates lipidomic patterns of these cells that differ from those established by two other robust geroprotectors, namely the <i>tor1Δ</i> mutation and lithocholic acid."

Here we show that resveratrol and other STACs activate sirtuins from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and extend the lifespan of these animals without reducing fecundity. Lifespan extension is dependent on functional Sir2, and is not observed when nutrients are restricted.

With lifespans exceeding months to years, age-related experiments involving fish and mammals can be overtly costly, both in terms of time and funding. The freshwater crustacean, Daphnia, has a relatively short lifespan (∼50 to 100 days), which makes it a cost-effective alternative animal model for longevity and aging studies. Besides age-specific mortality, there are a suite of physiological responses connected to \"healthspan\" that can be tracked as these animals age including growth, reproduction, and metabolic rates. These responses can be complemented by assessment of molecular and cellular processes connected to aging and health. Lifespan and metabolism of this model organism is responsive to long studied modulators of aging, such as rearing temperature and nutritional manipulation, but also pharmacological agents that target aging, e.g., rapamycin, which adds to its usefulness as a model organism. Here we describe how to culture Daphnia for aging experiments including maintaining laboratory populations of Daphnia mothers, growing algal food, and manipulating nutrition of these animals. In addition, we provide methods for tracking common physiological and longevity responses of Daphnia.

Here we use the cyclical parthenogenetic Daphnia pulex to evaluate the role of a fluctuating thermal environment on both reproduction and lifespan across six food concentrations. We test the hypotheses that (1) caloric restriction extends lifespan; (2) maximal reproduction will come with a cost of shortened lifespan; and (3) at a given food concentration, relative to a metabolically equivalent constant temperature environment a diel fluctuating thermal environment will alter the allocation of energy to reproduction and lifespan to maintain homeostasis. We did not identify a level of food concentration that extended lifespan in response to caloric restriction, and we found no cost of reproduction in terms of lifespan. Rather, the individuals at the highest food levels generally had the highest reproductive output and the longest lifespans, the individuals at the intermediate food level decreased reproduction and maintained lifespan, and the individuals at the three lower food concentrations had a decrease in reproduction and lifespan as would be predicted with increasing levels of starvation. Fluctuating temperature had no effect on lifespan at any food concentration, but delayed time to reproductive maturity and decreased early reproductive output at all food concentrations. This suggests that a fluctuating temperature regimen activates molecular pathways that alter energy allocation. The costs of fluctuating temperature on reproduction were not consistent across the lifespan. Statistical interactions for age of peak reproduction and lifetime fecundity suggest that senescence of the reproductive system may vary between temperature regimens at the different food concentrations."

Research aimed at understanding the mechanism by which CR slows aging has focused heavily on insulin and downstream signaling cascades. Glucagon, a hormone that counter-regulates insulin, is commonly affected by these same interventions. To investigate the role of glucagon in aging we used dietary manipulation, global and liver-specific glucagon receptor knockout, and pharmacological glucagon receptor activation. We found that globally eliminating glucagon receptor signaling (Gcgr KO) decreases median lifespan by 35% in lean mice. These lifespan shortening effects are more robust in diet-induced obese mice (54%). Extending these findings to metabolic health, we found that glucagon receptor signaling is indispensable to the metabolic response to chronic CR in young and aged mice. While CR decreased liver fat, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol in WT mice, these metabolic benefits were absent in Gcgr KO mice. In line with these observations, we found that critical nutrient sensing pathways known to improve aging are dysregulated in mice lacking glucagon receptor signaling at the liver (Gcgr <sup>hep-/-</sup> ). Liver-specific deletion of the glucagon receptor decreases hepatic AMP Kinase activation in aging mice, regardless of diet. Further, CR decreases hepatic mTOR activity in WT mice, but not in Gcgr <sup>hep-/-</sup> mice. Together, these findings propose that glucagon signaling plays a critical role in both normal aging and the lifespan and healthspan extension driven by caloric restriction."

However, recent studies in yeast suggested that this osmolyte can protect cells and cellular proteins from oxidative damage elicited by exogenously added reactive oxygen species (ROS). Trehalose has been also shown to affect stability, folding, and aggregation of bacterial and firefly proteins heterologously expressed in heat-shocked yeast cells. Our recent investigation of how a lifespan-extending caloric restriction (CR) diet alters the metabolic history of chronologically aging yeast suggested that their longevity is programmed by the level of metabolic capacity - including trehalose biosynthesis and degradation - that yeast cells developed prior to entry into quiescence. To investigate whether trehalose homeostasis in chronologically aging yeast may play a role in longevity extension by CR, in this study we examined how single-gene-deletion mutations affecting trehalose biosynthesis and degradation impact (1) the age-related dynamics of changes in trehalose concentration; (2) yeast chronological lifespan under CR conditions; (3) the chronology of oxidative protein damage, intracellular ROS level and protein aggregation; and (4) the timeline of thermal inactivation of a protein in heat-shocked yeast cells and its subsequent reactivation in yeast returned to low temperature. Our data imply that CR extends yeast chronological lifespan in part by altering a pattern of age-related changes in trehalose concentration. We outline a model for molecular mechanisms underlying the essential role of trehalose in defining yeast longevity by modulating protein folding, misfolding, unfolding, refolding, oxidative damage, solubility, and aggregation throughout lifespan."

However, how late in life application of caloric restriction can extend fly life is not clear. Here we show that late-life calorie restriction increases lifespan in female Drosophila melanogaster aged on a high-calorie diet. This shift results in rapid decrease in mortality rate and extends fly lifespan. In contrast, shifting female flies from a low- to a high-calorie diet leads to a rapid increase in mortality and shorter lifespan. These changes are mediated by immediate metabolic and physiological adaptations. One of such adaptation is rapid adjustment in egg production, with flies directing excess energy towards egg production when shifted to a high diet, or away from reproduction in females shifted to low-caloric diet. However, lifelong female fecundity reveals no associated fitness cost due to CR when flies are shifted to a high-calorie diet. In view of high conservation of the beneficial effects of CR on physiology and lifespan in a wide variety of organisms, including humans, our findings could provide valuable insight into CR applications that could provide health benefits later in life."

The central research question addresses how different classes of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL) and their metabolic pathways influence aging processes and longevity, with a focus on both disease-related and species-specific mechanisms. METHODS: This study synthesizes data mostly from 2015 to 2024, including experimental research in animal models (rodents, primates, C. elegans, D. melanogaster), epidemiological studies in humans, and comparative analyses of lipid profiles across vertebrates and invertebrates. It also examines molecular signaling pathways and evaluates biomedical interventions. RESULTS: Disruptions in lipoprotein metabolism-particularly elevated LDL-C and VLDL-C levels-are strongly associated with age-related diseases and reduced lifespan in both humans and animal models. In contrast, high HDL-C levels and efficient reverse cholesterol transport are consistently linked to longevity. Species such as birds and cold-water fish exhibit unique lipid profiles that allow high cholesterol without pathological consequences, indicating evolutionary adaptations. Molecular mechanisms involving lipid-sensitive signaling pathways further modulate aging. Therapeutic and dietary interventions targeting lipoprotein metabolism show potential for lifespan extension. CONCLUSION: Lipoprotein metabolism plays a central role in determining healthspan and longevity. Understanding the cross-species diversity and regulatory mechanisms of lipid transport provides critical insights into aging biology. Advances in pharmacology, nutrition, and genetic technology offer promising tools to modulate lipoprotein profiles and promote healthy aging in humans."

Here we show that dietary restriction during chronological aging delays the reduction in subsequent replicative life span up to at least 23days of chronological age. We further show that among the viable portion of the control population aged 26days, individual cells with the lowest mitochondrial membrane potential have the longest subsequent replicative lifespan. These observations demonstrate that dietary restriction modulates a common molecular mechanism linking chronological and replicative aging in yeast and indicate a critical role for mitochondrial function in this process."

            "abstract": "The age-related decrease in immunologic function is believed to be the major predisposing factor contributing to increased morbidity and mortality with age. Hence, the restoration of immunologic function is expected to have a beneficial effect in reducing pathology and maintaining a healthy condition in advanced age. Among various intervention strategies, caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to be the most powerful modulator of aging process. It is the most efficacious means of increasing longevity and reducing pathology. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its beneficial and robust action on various physiological systems, including the immune system. Experimental evidence suggests that CR increases longevity and reduces pathology through its action on the immune system. The observation that CR attenuates immunosenescence has provided a rationale for studying whether CR exerts its action through modulation of gene expression. The available data indicate that the effect of CR on signal transduction and gene expression can vary considerably from gene to gene and from one signaling molecule to another. This review summarizes the studies on the influence of CR on aging immune system and discusses the current state of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the immunomodulatory action of caloric restriction."

However, why autophagy is harmful in certain contexts remains unexplained. Here, we show that mitochondrial permeability defines the impact of autophagy on aging. Elevated autophagy unexpectedly shortens lifespan in C. elegans lacking serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase-1 (sgk-1) because of increased mitochondrial permeability. In sgk-1 mutants, reducing levels of autophagy or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening restores normal lifespan. Remarkably, low mitochondrial permeability is required across all paradigms examined of autophagy-dependent lifespan extension. Genetically induced mPTP opening blocks autophagy-dependent lifespan extension resulting from caloric restriction or loss of germline stem cells. Mitochondrial permeability similarly transforms autophagy into a destructive force in mammals, as liver-specific Sgk knockout mice demonstrate marked enhancement of hepatocyte autophagy, mPTP opening, and death with ischemia/reperfusion injury. Targeting mitochondrial permeability may maximize benefits of autophagy in aging."

However, their benefits are limited and their connections to the underlying mechanisms of aging are not fully clear. Here, these connections are explored in terms of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Krebs cycle, citric acid cycle) to suggest reasons for the loss of effectiveness and ways of overcoming it. Specifically, the metabolic interventions deplete acetate and likely reduce the conversion of oxaloacetate to aspartate, thereby inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and upregulating autophagy. Synthesis of glutathione may provide a high-capacity sink for amine groups, facilitating autophagy, and prevent buildup of alpha-ketoglutarate, supporting stem cell maintenance. Metabolic interventions also prevent the accumulation of succinate, thereby slowing DNA hypermethylation, facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, reducing inflammatory and hypoxic signaling, and lowering reliance on glycolysis. In part through these mechanisms, metabolic interventions may decelerate aging, extending lifespan. Conversely, with overnutrition or oxidative stress, these processes function in reverse, accelerating aging and impairing longevity. Progressive damage to aconitase, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, and downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) emerge as potentially modifiable reasons for the loss of effectiveness of metabolic interventions."

We identify certain parallels between mouse and human systems and review the theoretical and empirical support for the claim that the large divergence in the rate of aging between the two species resides in differences in the stability of their metabolic networks. We will show that these differences in metabolic stability have their origin in the different ecological constraints the species experience during their evolutionary history. We exploit these ideas to compare the effect of caloric restriction on murine and human systems. The studies predict that the large increases in mean life span and maximum life-span potential observed in laboratory rodents subject to caloric restriction will not obtain in human populations. We predict that, in view of the different metabolic stability of the two systems, caloric restriction will have no effect on the maximum life-span potential of humans, and a relatively minor effect on the mean life span of nonobese populations. This article thus points to certain intrinsic limitations in the use of mouse models in elucidating the aging process in humans. We furthermore contend the view that these limitations can be mitigated by considering the metabolic stability of the two species."

When coupled with the growing epidemic of overweight and obesity, nutritional strategies have garnered considerable research attention due to their potential to modulate both aging and metabolism at the cellular and molecular levels. Several key nutritional influences are currently being studied for their effects on aging biology, including caloric restriction, protein restriction, time-restricted eating, ketosis, and the gut microbiome. Of particular relevance is the role of dietary interventions in older adults with obesity, which must carefully balance the cardiometabolic benefits of weight loss with the unintended musculoskeletal losses, including muscle and bone mass. To discuss these critical issues, the Research Centers Collaborative Network sponsored a 1.5-d multidisciplinary workshop bringing together basic, clinical, and translational scientists in the fields of nutrition and aging biology. This meeting included sessions on calorie and protein restriction, timing of food intake, the gut microbiome, and obesity treatment for older adults. The agenda and recordings are archived at https://www.rccn-aging.org/nutrition-and-aging-biology. In this article, we describe the workshop's themes and discussions and highlight research gaps that, if filled, will considerably advance our understanding of the role of nutrition in healthy aging."

In 70 years of study, such beneficial effects have been demonstrated in rodents and lower animals. Recent results emerging from ongoing studies of CR in humans and nonhuman primates suggest that many of the same anti-disease and anti-aging benefits observed in rodent studies may be applicable to long-lived species. Results of studies in rhesus monkeys indicate that CR animals (30% less than controls) are healthier than fully-fed counterparts based on reduced incidence of various diseases, exhibit significantly better indices of predisposition to disease and may be aging at a slower rate based on analysis of selected indices of aging. The current review discusses approaches taken in studies of rhesus monkeys to analyze age-related changes in brain and behavioral function and the impact of CR on these changes. Approaches include analyses of gross and fine locomotor performance as well as brain imaging. In a related study it was observed that short-term CR (6 months) in adult rhesus monkeys can provide protection against a neurotoxic insult. Increasing interest in the CR paradigm will expand its role in demonstrating how nutrition can modulate the rate of aging and the mechanisms responsible for this modulation."

Until recently, however, almost nothing was known about these mechanisms in metazoans. Recent advances in our understanding of the genetic bases of energy sensing and lifespan control in yeast, invertebrates and mammals have begun to solve this puzzle.

In the present review, we discuss the potential role of the IGF-1 system in modulation of longevity, hypothesizing that the endocrine and metabolic adaptation observed in centenarians and in mammals during caloric restriction may be a physiological strategy for extending lifespan through a slower cell growing/metabolism, a better physiologic reserve capacity, a shift of cellular metabolism from cell proliferation to repair activities and a decrease in accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, understanding of the link between IGF-1/insulin system and longevity may have future clinical applications in promoting healthy aging and in Rehabilitation Medicine."

Previously, we have summarized CR and RAS-bl's converging effects, and the mitochondrial function changes associated with their physiological benefits. mTOR inhibition and enhanced sirtuin and KLOTHO signaling contribute to the benefits of CR in aging. mTORC1/mTORC2 complexes contribute to cell growth and metabolic regulation. Prolonged mTORC1 activation may lead to age-related disease progression; thus, rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition and CR may extend lifespan and retard aging through mTORC1 interference. Sirtuins by deacetylating histone and transcription-related proteins modulate signaling and survival pathways and mitochondrial functioning. CR regulates several mammalian sirtuins favoring their role in aging regulation. KLOTHO/fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) contribute to control Ca(2+), phosphate, and vitamin D metabolism, and their dysregulation may participate in age-related disease. Here we review how mTOR inhibition extends lifespan, how KLOTHO functions as an aging suppressor, how sirtuins mediate longevity, how vitamin D loss may contribute to age-related disease, and how they relate to mitochondrial function. Also, we discuss how RAS-bl downregulates mTOR and upregulates KLOTHO, sirtuin, and vitamin D receptor expression, suggesting that at least some of RAS-bl benefits in aging are mediated through the modulation of mTOR, KLOTHO, and sirtuin expression and vitamin D signaling, paralleling CR actions in age retardation. Concluding, the available evidence endorses the idea that RAS-bl is among the interventions that may turn out to provide relief to the spreading issue of age-associated chronic disease."

These rapid physiological effects are closely linked to patterns of gene expression in liver and heart. Non-human primate and human studies suggest that the signal transduction pathways responsible for the lifespan and health effects of caloric restriction (CR) may also be involved in human longevity. Thus, pharmaceuticals capable of mimicking the effects of CR (and other methods of lifespan extension) may have application to human health. OBJECTIVE: We show that lifespan studies are an inefficient and theoretically problematic way of screening for longevity therapeutics. We review studies suggesting that rapid changes in patterns of gene expression can be used to identify pharmaceuticals capable of mimicking some positive effects of caloric restriction. RESULTS: We present a traditional study of the effects of melatonin, melatonin and pregnenolone, aminoguanidine, aminoguanidine and alpha-lipoic acid, aminoguanidine, alpha-lipoic acid, pregnenolone, and coenzyme-Q(10) on the lifespan of mice. No treatment extended lifespan. However, because the mice die mostly of cancer, only chemopreventives active against specific cancers can be identified by such studies. The studies were also time-consuming and expensive. We discuss high-density microarray studies of the effectiveness of glucoregulatory drugs and putative cancer chemopreventatives at reproducing the hepatic gene-expression profiles of long-term and short-term CR. We describe the identification of one compound, metformin, which reproduces a subset of the gene-expression and physiological effects of CR. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that gene-expression biomarkers may be superior to lifespan studies for initial screening of candidate longevity therapeutics."

Here, we assessed how caloric restriction influences morphological, biochemical and cell biological properties of chronologically aging yeast advancing through different stages of the aging process. Our findings revealed that this low-calorie diet slows yeast chronological aging by mechanisms that coordinate the spatiotemporal dynamics of various cellular processes before entry into a non-proliferative state and after such entry. Caloric restriction causes a stepwise establishment of an aging-delaying cellular pattern by tuning a network that assimilates the following: 1) pathways of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; 2) communications between the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, peroxisomes, mitochondria and the cytosol; and 3) a balance between the processes of mitochondrial fusion and fission. Through different phases of the aging process, the caloric restriction-dependent remodeling of this intricate network 1) postpones the age-related onsets of apoptotic and liponecrotic modes of regulated cell death; and 2) actively increases the chance of cell survival by supporting the maintenance of cellular proteostasis. Because caloric restriction decreases the risk of cell death and actively increases the chance of cell survival throughout chronological lifespan, this dietary intervention extends longevity of chronologically aging yeast."

Aging is a major risk factor for PD and thus, interventions that delay aging will have promising effects in PD and other synucleinopathies. Caloric restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention shown to promote lifespan extension in several model organisms. CR has been shown to alleviate syn toxicity and herein we confirmed the same effect on the yeast model for synucleinopathies during chronological lifespan. The data gathered showed that TOR1 deletion also results in similar longevity extension and abrogation of syn toxicity. Intriguingly, these interventions were associated with decreased autophagy, which was maintained at homeostatic levels. Autophagy maintenance at homeostatic levels promoted by CR or TOR1 abrogation in syn-expressing cells was achieved by decreasing Sir2 levels and activity. Furthermore, the opposite function of Tor1 and Sir2 in autophagy is probably associated with the maintenance of autophagy activity at homeostatic levels, a central event linked to abrogation of syn toxicity promoted by CR."

Each of the interventions studied induced variable changes in the concentrations of proteins across liver, kidney, and gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples, with the strongest responses in the liver and limited concordance in protein responses across tissues. To the extent that these interventions promote longevity through common biological mechanisms, we anticipated that proteins associated with longevity could be identified by characterizing shared responses across all or multiple interventions. Many of the proteome alterations induced by each intervention were distinct, potentially implicating a variety of biological pathways as being related to lifespan extension. While we found no protein that was affected similarly by every intervention, we identified a set of proteins that responded to multiple interventions. These proteins were functionally diverse but tended to be involved in peroxisomal oxidation and metabolism of fatty acids. These results provide candidate proteins and biological mechanisms related to enhancing longevity that can inform research on therapeutic approaches to promote healthy aging."

With brain aging, various changes occur at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels, such as loss of proteostasis; dysregulation of nutrient sensing; abnormalities in the functions of mitochondria; and changes in neurophysiology. These changes also affect cognitive capabilities and result in mild to severe cognitive impairment. The three main mechanisms of brain aging, namely, senescence, inflammation, and oxidative stress, are being investigated in experimental models. Interventions such as caloric restriction, ketone diets, and intermittent fasting have shown the potential for slowing brain aging by modulating nutrition-sensing pathways, which improve metabolic health, decrease oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses. However, noncompliance with these traditional interventions makes them inefficient. To overcome this drawback, caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs), which tend to produce greater effects than traditional methods without affecting dietary intake, are better therapeutic options. This chapter focuses on the transition of CRMs from preclinical to clinical trials in humans."

Autophagy could eliminate redundant production of ROS in aging stem cells and helps to maintain the proliferation capacity by restraining the expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. Current studies showed that improving autophagy could restore the regenerative ability of aging stem cells. Therefore, it is important for an organism to maintain the appropriate autophagy.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of food pH on adult Drosophila lifespan, feeding behavior, and microbiota composition and tested the hypothesis that pH-mediated changes in palatability and total consumption are required for modulating longevity. METHODS: We measured the effect of buffered food (pH 5, 7, or 9) on male gustatory responses (proboscis extension), total food intake, and male and female lifespan. The effect of food pH on germfree male lifespan was also assessed. Changes in fly-associated microbial composition as a result of food pH were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Male gustatory responses, total consumption, and male and female longevity were additionally measured in the taste-defective Pox neuro (Poxn) mutant and its transgenic rescue control. RESULTS: An acidic diet increased Drosophila gustatory responses (40-230%) and food intake (5-50%) and extended survival (10-160% longer median lifespan) compared with flies on either neutral or alkaline pH food. Alkaline food pH shifted the composition of fly-associated bacteria and resulted in greater lifespan extension (260% longer median survival) after microbes were eliminated compared with flies on an acidic (50%) or neutral (130%) diet. However, germfree flies lived longer on an acidic diet (5-20% longer median lifespan) compared with those on either neutral or alkaline pH food. Gustatory responses, total consumption, and longevity were unaffected by food pH in Poxn mutant flies. CONCLUSIONS: Food pH can directly influence palatability and feeding behavior and affect parameters such as microbial growth to ultimately affect Drosophila lifespan. Fundamental food properties altered by dietary or drug interventions may therefore contribute to changes in animal physiology, metabolism, and survival."

The conceptual framework of the paper suggests the need of a newer light of the aging processes namely by a holistic human-gero-ecological model and a personality oriented geriatry.

Here we summarize the existing data on the effects of nutritional and pharmacological anti-aging interventions such as nutrition regimens, diet and dietary supplementation on the lifespan of male and female Drosophila. We demonstrate that males and females have different sensitivities to interventions and that the effects are highly dependent on genetic background, mating, dose and exposure duration.

ROS creates oxidative damage and, consequently, fuels the aging process. As such, the astonishing longevity of avian species correlates well with their lower levels of ROS production, in comparison to mammals of similar size. Apart from this inter-species difference, caloric restriction (CR) is a widely-documented means of increasing intra-species longevity, and it works by decreasing ROS production. However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible, either for the retardation of aging in CR or for the longevity of long-living species. Recent findings have shown an increase in uncoupling protein (UCP) activity with lower ROS levels, after CR stress. These UCPs are stimulated by fatty acids. Moreover, in numerous studies, fatty acids have been demonstrated to generate a reduction in ROS generation. Thus, the decreased ROS production seen in both CR and longer lifespan may occur via up-regulation of free fatty acid stimulation of UCP activity. Consequently, free fatty acids may play an important regulatory role in longevity, by reducing ROS, via actions on UCPs."

SNCA is a naturally aggregation-prone protein, which may be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and by lysosomal degradation pathways. Besides being a target of the proteolytic systems, SNCA can also alter the function of these pathways further, contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration. Deterioration of UPS and autophagy activities with aging further aggravates this toxic cycle. Caloric restriction (CR) is still the most effective non-genetic intervention promoting lifespan extension. It is known that CR-mediated lifespan extension is linked to the regulation of proteolytic systems, but the mechanisms underlying CR rescue of SNCA toxicity remain poorly understood. This study shows that CR balances UPS and autophagy activities during aging. CR enhances UPS activity, reversing the decline of the UPS activity promoted by SNCA, and keeps autophagy at homeostatic levels. Maintenance of autophagy at homeostatic levels appears to be relevant for UPS activity and for the mechanism underlying rescue of cells from SNCA-mediated toxicity by CR."

We show that the identity of old fibroblasts becomes undefined, with the fibroblast states present in young skin no longer clearly demarcated. In addition, old fibroblasts not only reduce the expression of genes involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, but also gain adipogenic traits, paradoxically becoming more similar to neonatal pro-adipogenic fibroblasts. These alterations are sensitive to systemic metabolic changes: long-term caloric restriction reversibly prevents them, whereas a high-fat diet potentiates them. Our results therefore highlight loss of cell identity and the acquisition of adipogenic traits as a mechanism underlying cellular aging, which is influenced by systemic metabolism."

High-throughput RNAi screens in worms determined a number of genes that modulate lifespan when silenced. Transcriptional profiling of the fly head identified a molecular pathway, the 'response to light' gene set, that increases expression with age and could be directly related to the tendency for a reduction in light levels to extend fly's lifespan. In mouse, comparing the gene expression profiles of several drugs to the gene expression profile of caloric restriction identified metformin as a drug whose action could potentially mimic caloric restriction in vivo. Finally, genes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain group decrease expression with age in the human, mouse, fly, and worm."

A standard analysis, using \"aging rates,\" is of limited use for understanding the effects of CR in delaying mortality in certain strains. However, when the effect of the diets on body weight and the known effects on sex-specific P-450 isoenzyme expression are compared, these effects suggest a mechanism for the action of CR. By comparative analysis, the effect of CR on tumor pathology suggests that the same mechanisms responsible for inhibiting reproduction may be responsible for delaying the aging-related increase in incidence of diseases. Based on these data, the adaptive/longevity-related process theory of CR is modified to incorporate aspects of the disposable soma theory of aging, as well as pleiotropism."

The prevalence of sarcopenia was reported to be up to 29% in older persons in the community healthcare setting. Sarcopenia diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of low muscle mass plus low muscle strength or low physical performance. Sarcopenia management options include non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Non-pharmacological approaches include resistance exercise and adequate nutrition. Of the two, resistance exercise is the standard non-pharmacological treatment approach for sarcopenia with significant positive evidence. Some dietary approaches such as adequate intake of protein, vitamin D, antioxidant nutrients, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid have been shown to have positive effects against sarcopenia. Currently, no specific drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of sarcopenia. However, several agents, including growth hormone, anabolic or androgenic steroids, selective androgenic receptor modulators, protein anabolic agents, appetite stimulants, myostatin inhibitors, activating II receptor drugs, β-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and troponin activators, are recommended and have been shown to have variable efficacy. Future research should focus on sarcopenia biological pathway and improved diagnostic approaches such as biomarkers for early detection, development of consistently pre-eminent treatment methods for severe sarcopenia patients, and establishing sensitive measures for predicting sarcopenia treatment response."

            "abstract": "The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia. EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics-European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document. The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity? For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as 'presarcopenia', 'sarcopenia' and 'severe sarcopenia'. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research. Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a serious public health concern among older adults worldwide. Exercise is the most common intervention for sarcopenia. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different exercise types for older adults with sarcopenia. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of exercise interventions on patient-important outcomes for older adults with sarcopenia were eligible. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Ovid until 3 June 2022. We used frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses to summarize the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations framework to rate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Our search identified 5988 citations, of which 42 RCTs proved eligible with 3728 participants with sarcopenia (median age: 72.9 years, female: 73.3%) with a median follow-up of 12 weeks. We are interested in patient-important outcomes that include mortality, quality of life, muscle strength and physical function measures. High or moderate certainty evidence suggested that resistance exercise with or without nutrition and the combination of resistance exercise with aerobic and balance training were the most effective interventions for improving quality of life compared to usual care (standardized mean difference from 0.68 to 1.11). Moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance and balance exercise plus nutrition (mean difference [MD]: 4.19 kg) was the most effective for improving handgrip strength (minimally important difference [MID]: 5 kg). Resistance and balance exercise with or without nutrition (MD: 0.16 m/s, moderate) were the most effective for improving physical function measured by usual gait speed (MID: 0.1 m/s). Moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance and balance exercise (MD: 1.85 s) was intermediately effective for improving physical function measured by timed up and go test (MID: 2.1 s). High certainty evidence showed that resistance and aerobic, or resistance and balance, or resistance and aerobic exercise plus nutrition (MD from 1.72 to 2.28 s) were intermediately effective for improving physical function measured by the five-repetition chair stand test (MID: 2.3 s). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with sarcopenia, high or moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance exercise with or without nutrition and the combination of resistance exercise with aerobic and balance training were the most effective interventions for improving quality of life. Adding nutritional interventions to exercise had a larger effect on handgrip strength than exercise alone while showing a similar effect on other physical function measures."

They are characterized by low bone density and loss of muscle mass and strength, factors which reduce the quality of life and mobility. Recently, apart from pharmaceutical interventions, many studies have focused on non-pharmaceutical approaches for the prevention of osteoporosis and sarcopenia with exercise and nutrition to being the most important and well studied of those. The purpose of the current narrative review is to describe the role of exercise and nutrition on prevention of osteoporosis and sarcopenia in older adults and to define the incidence of osteosarcopenia. Most of the publications which were included in this review show that resistance and endurance exercises prevent the development of osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Furthermore, protein and vitamin D intake, as well as a healthy diet, present a protective role against the development of the above bone diseases. However, current scientific data are not sufficient for reaching solid conclusions. Although the roles of exercise and nutrition on osteoporosis and sarcopenia seem to have been largely evaluated in literature over the recent years, most of the studies which have been conducted present high heterogeneity and small sample sizes. Therefore, they cannot reach final conclusions. In addition, osteosarcopenia seems to be caused by the effects of osteoporosis and sarcopenia on elderly. Larger meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials are needed designed based on strict inclusion criteria, in order to describe the exact role of exercise and nutrition on osteoporosis and sarcopenia."

This paper presents evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of sarcopenia from the task force of the International Conference on Sarcopenia and Frailty Research (ICSFR). METHODS: To develop the guidelines, we drew upon the best available evidence from two systematic reviews paired with consensus statements by international working groups on sarcopenia. Eight topics were selected for the recommendations: (i) defining sarcopenia; (ii) screening and diagnosis; (iii) physical activity prescription; (iv) protein supplementation; (v) vitamin D supplementation; (vi) anabolic hormone prescription; (vii) medications under development; and (viii) research. The ICSFR task force evaluated the evidence behind each topic including the quality of evidence, the benefit-harm balance of treatment, patient preferences/values, and cost-effectiveness. Recommendations were graded as either strong or conditional (weak) as per the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Consensus was achieved via one face-to-face workshop and a modified Delphi process. RECOMMENDATIONS: We make a conditional recommendation for the use of an internationally accepted measurement tool for the diagnosis of sarcopenia including the EWGSOP and FNIH definitions, and advocate for rapid screening using gait speed or the SARC-F. To treat sarcopenia, we strongly recommend the prescription of resistance-based physical activity, and conditionally recommend protein supplementation/a protein-rich diet. No recommendation is given for Vitamin D supplementation or for anabolic hormone prescription. There is a lack of robust evidence to assess the strength of other treatment options."

In this paper, micronutrients, macronutrients, and food groups have been reviewed, along with their studied effects on the prevalence and incidence of sarcopenia, as well as their ability to preserve muscle mass and optimize physical performance. Randomized controlled trials appear to suggest a critical role for dietary intake of protein in preventing sarcopenia and muscle loss, although the optimal dose and type of protein is unknown. There are some promising data regarding the role of vitamin D and sarcopenia, but it is unclear whether the dose, frequency of dose, or length of treatment impacts the efficacy of vitamin D on improving muscle mass or function. Selenium, magnesium, and omega 3 fatty acids have been studied as supplements in clinical trials and in the diet, and they appear to demonstrate a potential association with physical activity and muscle performance in older individuals. Following the Mediterranean diet and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables have been associated with improved physical performance and protection against muscle wasting, sarcopenia, and frailty."

The risk of sarcopenia begins in early adulthood, resulting in exaggerated muscle dysfunction in later life. Despite its clinical significance, research on youth-onset sarcopenia is still in its infancy. Due to a paucity of epidemiologic data and standardized criteria for sarcopenia in youth, determining the prevalence of sarcopenia in the young population remains challenging. Based on the evidence, >1 in every 10 young adults of most ethnicities is estimated to have sarcopenia. This review summarizes the possible etiologies of sarcopenia in young populations, including metabolic syndrome, physical inactivity, inadequate nutrition, inherent and perinatal factors, vitamin D deficiency, endocrinopathy, an imbalance of gut microbiota, neuromuscular diseases, organ failure, malignancy, and other inflammatory disorders. This is the first review of the current knowledge on the importance, prevalence, diagnosis, and causes of sarcopenia in youth."

Definitions of both sarcopenia and frailty are still developing, and both concepts clearly overlap in their physical aspects. Malnutrition (both undernutrition and obesity) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of frailty and sarcopenia. The quality of the diet along the lifespan has a close relation with the incidence of both entities, and nutritional interventions may be able to reduce the incidence or revert either of them. This brief review explores the role of energy and protein intake and other key nutrients on muscle function. Nutrition may be a key element of multimodal interventions for frailty and sarcopenia. The results of the \"Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\" (SPRINTT) trial will offer key insights on the effect of such interventions in frail, sarcopenic older individuals."

            "abstract": "An adequate and balanced diet is of utmost importance in recovery and rehabilitation. \"Rehabilitation nutrition\" for injury recovery of athletes is similar to sports nutrition, except for the differences that concern the prevention of the risk or presence of sarcopenia, malnutrition, or dysphagia. Rehabilitation nutrition also aims, combined with training, to an adequate long-term nutritional status of the athlete and also in physical condition improvement, in terms of endurance and resistance. The aim of this paper is to define the proper nutrition for athletes in order to hasten their return to the sports after surgery or injury. Energy intake should be higher than the energy target in order to fight sarcopenia-that is 25-30 kcal/kg of body weight. Macro- and micro-nutrients play an important role in metabolism, energy production, hemoglobin synthesis, lean mass and bone mass maintenance, immunity, health, and protection against oxidative damage. Nutritional strategies, such as supplementation of suboptimal protein intake with leucine are feasible and effective in offsetting anabolic resistance. Thus, maintaining muscle mass, without gaining fat, becomes challenging for the injured athlete. A dietary strategy should be tailored to the athlete's needs, considering amounts, frequency, type and, most of all, protein quality. During rehabilitation, simultaneous carbohydrates and protein intake can inhibit muscle breakdown and muscle atrophy. The long-term intake of omega-3 fatty acids enhances anabolic sensitivity to amino acids; thus, it may be beneficial to the injured athlete. Adequate intakes of macronutrients can play a major role supporting athletes' anabolism."

Pharmacological remedies are currently unavailable for preventing the development of sarcopenia, halting its progression, or impeding its negative health outcomes. The most effective strategies to contrast sarcopenia rely on the adoption of healthier lifestyle behaviors, including adherence to high-quality diets and regular physical activity. In this review, the role of nutrition in the prevention and management of sarcopenia is summarized. Special attention is given to current \"blockbuster\" dietary regimes and agents used to counteract age-related muscle wasting, together with their putative mechanisms of action. Issues related to the design and implementation of effective nutritional strategies are discussed, with a focus on unanswered questions on the most appropriate timing of nutritional interventions to preserve muscle health and function into old age. A brief description is also provided on new technologies that can facilitate the development and implementation of personalized nutrition plans to contrast sarcopenia."

In growing recognition of the importance of both muscle strength and muscle mass relative to body size in contributing to functional decline, recent definitions have now incorporated grip strength and a correction for body mass as part of the key criteria that define sarcopenia. With this new definition, a much larger population of older adults are now at risk of sarcopenia. In the present article, we reviewed the literature for studies which tested the effects of diet or exercise interventions on changes in lean mass and/or functional outcomes in individuals with either sarcopenia and/or frailty and identified 19 clinical trials. There were a few key findings. First, dietary interventions involving protein supplementation improved functional and/or strength outcomes in a few trials; however, other dietary approaches were less effective. Exercise interventions and combined diet and exercise interventions produced consistent improvements in lower body muscle strength but had less consistent effects on walking speed and grip strength. Lifestyle interventions not involving calorie restriction generally did not induce significant changes in body composition. There were a limited number of trials in which participants with sarcopenia were specifically targeted, and thus there is an important need for more research to determine the appropriate types of intervention approaches for the high risk population of sarcopenic older adults."

We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic or frail older adults were included. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for LM, muscle strength, and physical function data. The analysis showed that whey protein supplementation had no effect on LM and muscle strength; nevertheless, a significant improvement was found in physical function (SMD = 0.561; 95% confidence interval [CIs]: 0.256, 0.865, n = 33), particularly gait speed (GS). On the contrary, whey protein supplementation significantly improved LM (SMD = 0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n = 11), appendicular lean mass and physical function (SMD = 1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n = 16), and GS in sarcopenic/frail older adults. By contrast, co-supplementation with vitamin D enhanced LM gains (SMD =0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n = 11), muscle strength (SMD =2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n = 11), and physical function (SMD = 3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n = 18) significantly. Muscle strength and physical function improvements after whey protein supplementation plus vitamin D were observed without resistance exercise (RE) and short study duration subgroups. Moreover, the combination of whey protein and vitamin D with RE did not enhance the effect of RE. Whey protein supplementation improved LM and function in sarcopenic/frail older adults but had no positive effect in healthy older persons. By contrast, our meta-analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D is effective, particularly in healthy older adults, which is likely owing, we propose, to the correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. The trial was registered at https://inplasy.com as INPLASY202240167."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is defined as a combination of low muscle mass with low muscle function. The term was first used to designate the loss of muscle mass and performance associated with aging. Now, recognized causes of sarcopenia also include chronic disease, a physically inactive lifestyle, loss of mobility, and malnutrition. Sarcopenia should be differentiated from cachexia, which is characterized not only by low muscle mass but also by weight loss and anorexia. Sarcopenia results from complex and interdependent pathophysiological mechanisms that include aging, physical inactivity, neuromuscular compromise, resistance to postprandial anabolism, insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, endocrine factors, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. The prevalence of sarcopenia ranges from 3% to 24% depending on the diagnostic criteria used and increases with age. Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis 20% to 30% have sarcopenia, which correlates with disease severity. Sarcopenia exacts a heavy toll of functional impairment, metabolic disorders, morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Thus, the consequences of sarcopenia include disability, quality of life impairments, falls, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, an increased cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome, and immunosuppression. The adverse effects of sarcopenia are particularly great in patients with a high fat mass, a condition known as sarcopenic obesity. The diagnosis of sarcopenia rests on muscle mass measurements and on functional tests that evaluate either muscle strength or physical performance (walking, balance). No specific biomarkers have been identified to date. The management of sarcopenia requires a multimodal approach combining a sufficient intake of high-quality protein and fatty acids, physical exercise, and antiinflammatory medications. Selective androgen receptor modulators and anti-myostatin antibodies are being evaluated as potential stimulators of muscle anabolism."

This condition, sarcopenia, has been widely observed with aging in sedentary adults. Regular aerobic and resistance exercise programs have been shown to counteract most aspects of sarcopenia. In addition, good nutrition, especially adequate protein and energy intake, can help limit and treat age-related declines in muscle mass, strength, and functional abilities. Protein nutrition in combination with exercise is considered optimal for maintaining muscle function. With the goal of providing recommendations for health care professionals to help older adults sustain muscle strength and function into older age, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) hosted a Workshop on Protein Requirements in the Elderly, held in Dubrovnik on November 24 and 25, 2013. Based on the evidence presented and discussed, the following recommendations are made (a) for healthy older people, the diet should provide at least 1.0-1.2 g protein/kg body weight/day, (b) for older people who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition because they have acute or chronic illness, the diet should provide 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day, with even higher intake for individuals with severe illness or injury, and (c) daily physical activity or exercise (resistance training, aerobic exercise) should be undertaken by all older people, for as long as possible."

About half of older male nursing home residents have sarcopenia. The diagnostic criteria by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) have led to increased interest in sarcopenia. Exercise and nutritional management are crucial for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Nutritional therapy for sarcopenia that includes 20 g of whey protein and 800 IU of vitamin D twice a day improves lower limb strength. Exercise therapy for sarcopenia, such as resistance training and 6 months of home exercises, improves muscle strength and physical function. Combination therapy that includes both nutritional and exercise therapy improves gait speed and knee extension strength more than either exercise alone or nutrition therapy alone. Excessive bedrest and mismanagement of nutrition in medical facilities can lead to iatrogenic sarcopenia. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is sarcopenia caused by the activities of health care workers in health care facilities. Appropriate nutritional management and exercise programs through rehabilitation nutrition are important for prevention and treatment of iatrogenic sarcopenia. Nutritional and exercise therapy should be started very early after admission and adjusted to the level of inflammation and disease status. Repeated assessment, diagnosis, goal setting, interventions, and monitoring using the rehabilitation nutrition care process is important to maximize treatment effectiveness and improve patients' functional recovery and quality of life."

Sarcopenia typically affects older people, but younger individuals with chronic disease are also at risk. The risk of sarcopenia is high (with a prevalence of ≥25%) in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and this rheumatoid sarcopenia is associated with increased likelihood of falls, fractures and physical disability, in addition to the burden of joint inflammation and damage. Chronic inflammation mediated by cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IFNγ contributes to aberrant muscle homeostasis (for instance, by exacerbating muscle protein breakdown), and results from transcriptomic studies have identified dysfunction of muscle stem cells and metabolism in RA. Progressive resistance exercise is an effective therapy for rheumatoid sarcopenia but it can be challenging or unsuitable for some individuals. The unmet need for anti-sarcopenia pharmacotherapies is great, both for people with RA and for otherwise healthy older adults."

The ESPEN Symposium on perioperative nutrition was held in Nottingham, UK, on 14-15 October 2018 and the aims of this document were to highlight the scientific basis for the nutritional and metabolic management of surgical patients. METHODS: This paper represents the opinion of experts in this multidisciplinary field and those of a patient and caregiver, based on current evidence. It highlights the current state of the art. RESULTS: Surgical patients may present with varying degrees of malnutrition, sarcopenia, cachexia, obesity and myosteatosis. Preoperative optimization can help improve outcomes. Perioperative fluid therapy should aim at keeping the patient in as near zero fluid and electrolyte balance as possible. Similarly, glycemic control is especially important in those patients with poorly controlled diabetes, with a stepwise increase in the risk of infectious complications and mortality per increasing HbA1c. Immobilization can induce a decline in basal energy expenditure, reduced insulin sensitivity, anabolic resistance to protein nutrition and muscle strength, all of which impair clinical outcomes. There is a role for pharmaconutrition, pre-, pro- and syn-biotics, with the evidence being stronger in those undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional assessment of the surgical patient together with the appropriate interventions to restore the energy deficit, avoid weight loss, preserve the gut microbiome and improve functional performance are all necessary components of the nutritional, metabolic and functional conditioning of the surgical patient."

A total of 37 RCTs were identified. Results indicate that physical exercise has a positive impact on muscle mass and muscle function in subjects aged 65 years and older. However, any interactive effect of dietary supplementation appears to be limited. INTRODUCTION: In 2013, Denison et al. conducted a systematic review including 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to explore the effect of combined exercise and nutrition intervention to improve muscle mass, muscle strength, or physical performance in older people. They concluded that further studies were needed to provide evidence upon which public health and clinical recommendations could be based. The purpose of the present work was to update the prior systematic review and include studies published up to October 2015. METHODS: Using the electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE, we identified RCTs which assessed the combined effect of exercise training and nutritional supplementation on muscle strength, muscle mass, or physical performance in subjects aged 60 years and over. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 21 additional RCTs giving a total of 37 RCTs. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of protocols for physical exercise and dietary supplementation (proteins, essential amino acids, creatine, β-hydroxy-β-methylbuthyrate, vitamin D, multi-nutrients, or other). In 79% of the studies (27/34 RCTs), muscle mass increased with exercise but an additional effect of nutrition was only found in 8 RCTs (23.5%). Muscle strength increased in 82.8% of the studies (29/35 RCTs) following exercise intervention, and dietary supplementation showed additional benefits in only a small number of studies (8/35 RCTS, 22.8%). Finally, the majority of studies showed an increase of physical performance following exercise intervention (26/28 RCTs, 92.8%) but interaction with nutrition supplementation was only found in 14.3% of these studies (4/28 RCTs). CONCLUSION: Physical exercise has a positive impact on muscle mass and muscle function in healthy subjects aged 60 years and older. The biggest effect of exercise intervention, of any type, has been seen on physical performance (gait speed, chair rising test, balance, SPPB test, etc.). We observed huge variations in regard to the dietary supplementation protocols. Based on the included studies, mainly performed on well-nourished subjects, the interactive effect of dietary supplementation on muscle function appears limited."

Since then, a broader definition comprising not only loss of muscle mass, but also loss of muscle strength and low physical performance due to ageing or other conditions, was developed and published in consensus papers from geriatric societies. Sarcopenia was proposed to be diagnosed based on operational criteria using two components of muscle abnormalities, low muscle mass and low muscle function. This brought awareness of an important nutritional derangement with adverse outcomes for the overall health. In parallel, many studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have shown that sarcopenia is a prevalent condition, mainly among patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis (HD). In CKD, sarcopenia is not necessarily age-related as it occurs as a result of the accelerated protein catabolism from the disease and from the dialysis procedure per se combined with low energy and protein intakes. Observational studies showed that sarcopenia and especially low muscle strength is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including worse quality of life (QoL) and higher hospitalization and mortality rates. This review aims to discuss the differences in conceptual definition of sarcopenia in the elderly and in CKD, as well as to describe etiology of sarcopenia, prevalence, outcome, and interventions that attempted to reverse the loss of muscle mass, strength and mobility in CKD and ESKD patients."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, dramatically affects the quality of life. Although there is a consensus that sarcopenia is a multifactorial syndrome, the etiology and underlying mechanisms are not yet delineated. Moreover, research about nutritional interventions to prevent the development of sarcopenia is mainly focused on the amount and quality of protein intake. The impact of several nutrition strategies that consider timing of food intake, anti-inflammatory nutrients, metabolic control, and the role of mitochondrial function on the progression of sarcopenia is not fully understood. This narrative review summarizes the metabolic background of this phenomenon and proposes an integral nutritional approach (including dietary supplements such as creatine monohydrate) to target potential molecular pathways that may affect reduce or ameliorate the adverse effects of sarcopenia. Lastly, miRNAs, in particular those produced by skeletal muscle (MyomiR), might represent a valid tool to evaluate sarcopenia progression as a potential rapid and early biomarker for diagnosis and characterization."

Studies published in languages other than English, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish were excluded. Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, CINAHL, AgeLine, and Food Science Source databases through January 31, 2022. A pooled effect size was calculated based on standard mean differences. RESULTS: Five cross-sectional studies, one longitudinal study, and one case-control study that investigated 3353 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of approximately 73 years were included. The meta-analysis of four studies indicated that older adults with sarcopenia consumed significantly less protein than their peers with no sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study suggest that an inadequate protein intake might be associated with sarcopenia in older adults."

            "abstract": "Muscle loss alone, or in the context of sarcopenia or cachexia, is a prevalent condition and a predictor of negative outcomes in aging and disease. As adequate nutrition is essential for muscle maintenance, a growing number of studies has been conducted to explore the role of specific nutrients on muscle mass or function. Nonetheless, more research is needed to guide evidence-based recommendations. This scoping review aimed to compile and document ongoing clinical trials investigating nutrition interventions as a strategy to prevent or treat low muscle mass or function (strength and physical performance), sarcopenia, or cachexia. ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched up to 21 April 2021 for planned and ongoing trials. Randomized controlled trials with ≥20 participants per arm were included based on intent to explore the effects of nutrition interventions on muscle-related outcomes (i.e. muscle mass or strength, physical performance, or muscle synthesis rate) in both clinical and non-clinical conditions (i.e. aging). Two reviewers independently screened records for eligibility, and a descriptive synthesis of trials characteristics was conducted. A total of 113 trials were included in the review. Most trials (69.0%) enroll adults with clinical conditions, such as cancer (19.5%), obesity and metabolic diseases (16.8%), and musculoskeletal diseases (10.7%). The effects of nutrition interventions on age-related muscle loss are explored in 31% of trials. Although nutrition interventions of varied types were identified, food supplements alone (48.7%) or combined with dietary advice (11.5%) are most frequently reported. Protein (17.7%), amino acids (10.6%), and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB, 6.2%) are the top three food supplements' nutrients under investigation. Primary outcome of most trials (54.9%) consists of measures of muscle mass alone or in combination with muscle strength and/or performance (as either primary or secondary outcomes). Muscle strength and physical performance are primary outcomes of 38% and 31.9% of the trials, respectively. These measurements were obtained using a variety of techniques. Only a few trials evaluate muscle synthesis rate either as a primary or secondary outcome (5.3%). Several nutrition studies focusing on muscle, sarcopenia, and cachexia are underway and can inform future research in this area. Although many trials have similar type of interventions, methodological heterogeneity may challenge study comparisons, and future meta-analyses aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations. Upcoming research in this area may benefit from guidelines for the assessment of therapeutic effects of nutrition interventions."

METHODS: PubMed and Dialog databases were searched (January 2000-October 2013) using pre-defined search terms. Prevalence studies and intervention studies investigating muscle mass plus strength or function outcome measures using the EWGSOP definition of sarcopenia, in well-defined populations of adults aged ≥50 years were selected. RESULTS: prevalence of sarcopenia was, with regional and age-related variations, 1-29% in community-dwelling populations, 14-33% in long-term care populations and 10% in the only acute hospital-care population examined. Moderate quality evidence suggests that exercise interventions improve muscle strength and physical performance. The results of nutrition interventions are equivocal due to the low number of studies and heterogeneous study design. Essential amino acid (EAA) supplements, including ∼2.5 g of leucine, and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB) supplements, show some effects in improving muscle mass and function parameters. Protein supplements have not shown consistent benefits on muscle mass and function. CONCLUSION: prevalence of sarcopenia is substantial in most geriatric settings. Well-designed, standardised studies evaluating exercise or nutrition interventions are needed before treatment guidelines can be developed. Physicians should screen for sarcopenia in both community and geriatric settings, with diagnosis based on muscle mass and function. Supervised resistance exercise is recommended for individuals with sarcopenia. EAA (with leucine) and HMB may improve muscle outcomes."

The primary outcome was the measure of treatment effect on muscle mass, and secondary outcomes were the treatment effect on muscle strength and physical performance. DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants with sarcopenia receiving interventions targeting sarcopenia in any setting. METHODS: Data sources: Relevant RCTs were identified by a systematic search of several electronic databases, including CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from January 1995 to July 2019. Duplicate title and abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed. DATA EXTRACTION: All RCTs examining sarcopenia interventions [mixed exercise (combined aerobic and resistance exercise), aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, balance exercise, physical activity and protein or nutrition supplementation, acupuncture, whole-body vibration, protein supplement or interventions to increase protein intake, any nutritional intervention other than protein, and pharmacotherapy] were included. Comparators were standard care, placebo, or another intervention. DATA SYNTHESIS: We performed Bayesian NMA; continuous outcome data were pooled using the standardized mean difference effect size. Interventions were ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each outcome. RESULTS: A total of 59 RCTs were included after screening of 4315 citations and 313 full-text articles. Network meta-analysis of muscle mass outcome (including 46 RCTs, 3649 participants, 11 interventions) suggested that mixed exercise were the most effective intervention (SUCRA = 93.94%) to increase muscle mass. Physical activity and protein or nutrition supplementation, and aerobic exercise were the most effective interventions to improve muscle strength and physical performance, respectively. Overall, mixed exercise is the most effective intervention in increasing muscle mass and was one of the 3 most effective interventions in increasing muscle strength and physical performance. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mixed exercise and physical activity with nutritional supplementation are the most effective sarcopenia interventions. Most of the included studies have a high risk of bias. More robust RCTs are needed to increase the confidence of our NMA results and the quality of evidence."

            "abstract": "The focus of nutrition is often on healthy diets and exercise to minimise the risk of developing lifestyle diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, during the shift into older years often the nutrition priorities change towards meeting increased nutrient needs with less energy requirements, and minimising lean muscle loss. There are several causes of general malnutrition in the elderly that lead to depletion of muscle including starvation (protein-energy malnutrition), sarcopenia and cachexia. The prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition increases with age and the number of comorbidities. A range of simple and validated screening tools can be used to identify malnutrition in older adults, e.g. MST, MNA-SF and 'MUST'. Older adults should be screened for nutritional issues at diagnosis, on admission to hospitals or care homes and during follow up at outpatient or General Practitioner clinics, at regular intervals depending on clinical status. Early identification and treatment of nutrition problems can lead to improved outcomes and better quality of life."

Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of exercise and nutrition on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in individuals with SO. Studies investigating the effects of exercise and nutrition on body composition, metabolic health, and physical performance in SO individuals were searched from electronic databases up to April 2019. Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise decreased body weight and fat mass (FM). Resistance exercise (RE) decreased FM and improved grip strength. The combination of aerobic exercise and RE decreased FM and improved walking speed. Nutritional intervention, especially low-calorie high-protein (LCHP) diet, decreased FM but did not affect muscle mass and grip strength. In addition to exercise training, nutrition did not provide extra benefits in outcome. Exercise, especially RE, is essential to improve body composition and physical performance in individuals with SO. Nutritional intervention with LCHP decreases FM but does not improve physical performance."

This review summarises the discussions of a working group [ESCEO working group meeting 8th September 2016] that met to review current evidence and to consider its implications for preventive and treatment strategies. The review points to the importance of 'healthier' dietary patterns that are adequate in quality in older age, to ensure sufficient intakes of protein, vitamin D, antioxidant nutrients and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. In particular, there is substantial evidence to support the roles of dietary protein and physical activity as key anabolic stimuli for muscle protein synthesis. However, much of the evidence is observational and from high-income countries. Further high-quality trials, particularly from more diverse populations, are needed to enable an understanding of dose and duration effects of individual nutrients on function, to elucidate mechanistic links, and to define optimal profiles and patterns of nutrient intake for older adults."

Sarcopenic dysphagia is characterized by decreased swallowing function; therefore, early detection of subclinical dysphagia and subsequent intervention appear to be crucial in the elderly. Numerous tools have been employed to measure the function, strength, and mass of swallowing-related muscles in sarcopenic elderly. The swallowing function can be evaluated by questionnaires like Eating Assessment Tool, Functional Oral Intake Scale, and Food Intake Level Scale, and tests such as the modified water swallowing test and videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Surface electromyography and high-resolution manometry can be applied for quantifying swallowing-related muscle strength. Modalities such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are capable of estimating the swallowing muscle mass. In patients with sarcopenic dysphagia, a thorough assessment should be given followed by an integrated intervention combining swallowing muscle strengthening, nutrition support, food texture modification, physical, and occupational therapies. This article aimed to comprehensively summarize the diagnostic criteria/tools as well as their associations/performance in sarcopenic dysphagia.

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia is a wasting disease, mostly age-related in which muscle strength and mass decline, such as physical performance. With aging, both lower dietary protein intake and anabolic resistance lead to sarcopenia. Moreover, aging and sarcopenia display low-grade inflammation, which also worsen muscle condition. In this review, we focused on these two main targets to study dietary strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The better understanding in mechanisms involved in sarcopenia helps building combined dietary approaches including physical activity that would slow the disease progression. New approaches include better understanding in the choice of quality proteins, their amount and schedule and the association with antioxidative nutrients. SUMMARY: First, anabolic resistance can be countered by increasing significantly protein intake. If increasing amount remains insufficient, the evenly delivery protein schedule provides interesting results on muscle strength. Quality of protein is also to consider for decreasing risk for sarcopenia, because varying sources of proteins appears relevant with increasing plant-based proteins ratio. Although new techniques have been developed, as plant-based proteins display a lower availability, we need to ensure an adapted overall amount of proteins. Finally, specific enrichment with leucine from whey protein remains the dietary combined approach most studied and studies on citrulline provide interesting results. As cofactor at the edge between anabolic and antioxidative properties, vitamin D supplementation is to recommend. Antioxidative dietary strategies include both fibers, vitamins, micronutrients and polyphenols from various sources for positive effects on physical performance. The ω 3 -polyunsaturated fatty acids also display positive modifications on body composition. Gut microbiota modifiers, such as prebiotics, are promising pathways to improve muscle mass and function and body composition in sarcopenic patients. Nutritional interventions could be enhanced by combination with physical activity on sarcopenia. In healthy older adults, promoting change in lifestyle to get near a Mediterranean diet could be one of the best options. In sarcopenia adults in which lifestyle changes appears unprobable, specific enrichement potentialized with physical activity will help in the struggle against sarcopenia. Longitudinal data are lacking, which makes it hard to draw strong conclusions. However, the effects of a physical activity combined with a set of nutrition interventions on sarcopenia seems promising."

DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In March 2022, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences using predefined search terms. Original studies on dietary mineral intake or mineral serum blood concentrations on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance or the prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults (average age ≥65 years) were included. METHODS: Eligibility screening and data extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. Quality assessment was performed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: From the 15,622 identified articles, a total of 45 studies were included in the review, mainly being cross-sectional and observational studies. Moderate quality of evidence showed that selenium (n = 8) and magnesium (n = 7) were significantly associated with muscle mass, strength, and physical performance as well as the prevalence of sarcopenia. For calcium and zinc, no association could be found. For potassium, iron, sodium, and phosphorus, the association with sarcopenic outcomes remains unclear as not enough studies could be included or were nonconclusive (low quality of evidence). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This systematic review shows a potential role for selenium and magnesium on the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in older adults. More randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine the impact of minerals on sarcopenia in older adults."

            "abstract": "The condition of muscle fiber atrophy and weakness that occurs in respiratory muscles along with systemic skeletal muscle with age is known as respiratory sarcopenia. The Japanese Working Group of Respiratory Sarcopenia of the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Nutrition narratively reviews these areas, and proposes the concept and diagnostic criteria. We have defined respiratory sarcopenia as \"whole-body sarcopenia and low respiratory muscle mass followed by low respiratory muscle strength and/or low respiratory function.\" Respiratory sarcopenia can be caused by various factors such as aging, decreased activity, undernutrition, disease, cachexia, and iatrogenic causes. We have also created an algorithm for diagnosing respiratory sarcopenia. Respiratory function decreases with age in healthy older people, along with low respiratory muscle mass and strength. We have created a new term, \"Presbypnea,\" meaning a decline in respiratory function with aging. Minor functional respiratory disability due to aging, such as that indicated by a modified Medical Research Council level 1 (troubled by shortness of breath when hurrying or walking straight up hill), is an indicator of presbypnea. We also define sarcopenic respiratory disability as \"a disability with deteriorated respiratory function that results from respiratory sarcopenia.\" Sarcopenic respiratory disability is diagnosed if respiratory sarcopenia is present with functional disability. Cases of respiratory sarcopenia without functional disability are diagnosed as \"at risk of sarcopenic respiratory disability.\" Functional disability is defined as a modified Medical Research Council grade of 2 or more. Rehabilitation nutrition, treatment that combines rehabilitation and nutritional management, may be adequate to prevent and treat respiratory sarcopenia and sarcopenic respiratory disability."

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between systemic inflammation, muscle strength and/or muscle mass in adults. METHODS: An electronic search using keywords such as 'acute phase proteins, cytokines and sarcopenia, muscle mass, muscle strength' was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase from inception until the 30th of June 2020. A meta-analysis using correlation data was performed to determine the overall relationship between inflammation and muscle strength and muscle mass in adults. RESULTS: Overall, 168 articles; 149 cross-sectional articles (n = 76,899 participants, 47.0 % male) and 19 longitudinal articles (n = 12,295 participants, 31.9 % male) met inclusion criteria. Independent of disease state, higher levels of C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were associated with lower handgrip and knee extension strength (CRP; r = -0.10, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.13, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.08, p < 0.001 and CRP; r = -0.18, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.11, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.13, p < 0.001 respectively) and muscle mass (CRP; r = -0.12, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.09, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.15, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers appeared to be associated with lower muscle strength and muscle mass over time. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers are significantly associated with lower skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass."

This paper assesses the comparative effects of exercise, nutrition, and the combination of exercise and nutrition on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia. In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, 11 electronic databases were searched up to November 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) adults aged 65 years and older with sarcopenia; (2) interventions of exercise, nutrition, or the combination of both; (3) the outcomes include at least one of the following: muscle mass, muscle strength (hand grip and knee extension strength), or physical performance (gait speed and dynamic balance); and (4) randomized control trials. For each outcome measurement, a network meta-analysis was conducted to determine the direct and indirect effects of each intervention compared with each of the other interventions. A total of 26 studies were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, exercise alone and the combination of exercise and nutrition significantly increased handgrip strength (1.12 kg, 95% CI: 0.12, 2.11; 2.03 kg, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.97) and improved dynamic balance (-1.76 seconds, 95% CI: -2.24, -1.28; -1.02 seconds, 95% CI: -1.64, -0.39). Both exercise alone and the combination of exercise and nutrition have beneficial effects on muscle strength and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Minerals may contribute to prevent and treat sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance. So far, there is no comprehensive review on the impact of minerals on sarcopenia outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the role of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, and zinc on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted between March 2016 and July 2016, in the PubMed database using predefined search terms. Articles on the role of dietary mineral intake or mineral serum concentrations on muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance, and/or the prevalence of sarcopenia in healthy or frail older adults (average age ≥ 65 years) were selected. Only original research publications were included. The search and data extraction were conducted in duplicate by 2 independent researchers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was followed in constructing this systematic review. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to evaluate the quality of the selected articles. RESULTS: From the 3346 articles found, a total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Observational studies showed that serum selenium (n = 1) and calcium intake (n = 1) were significantly associated with muscle mass, and magnesium (n = 1), selenium (n = 1), iron (n = 1), and zinc (n = 1) intake were significantly and positively associated with physical performance in older adults. Furthermore, magnesium (n = 2), selenium (n = 2), calcium (n = 2), and phosphorus (n = 1) intake were associated with the prevalence of sarcopenia. Magnesium supplementation improved physical performance based on one randomized controlled trial. No studies on the role of sodium or potassium on muscle mass, muscle strength, or physical performance were found. CONCLUSION: Minerals may be important nutrients to prevent and/or treat sarcopenia. Particularly, magnesium, selenium, and calcium seem to be most promising. Most of the included studies, however, were observational studies. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the potential benefits of mineral intake to prevent and/or treat sarcopenia and support healthy aging."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a significant health concern primarily affecting old adult individuals, characterized by age-related muscle loss, and decreased strength, power, and endurance. It has profound negative effects on overall health and quality of life, including reduced independence, mobility, and daily activity performance, osteoporosis, increased fall and fracture risks, metabolic issues, and chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Preventive strategies typically involve a combination of proper nutrition and regular physical activity. Among strength training exercises, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) stands out as the most effective approach for improving muscle function in older adults with sarcopenia. The current review identifies and summarizes the studies that have examined the effects of HIIT on muscle strength in older adults as an element of the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. A systematic search using several computerized databases, namely, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science, was performed on 12 January 2023, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 224 studies were initially retrieved. A total of five studies met the selection criteria. HIIT training shows improvements in body composition and functional and cardiorespiratory capacity, has benefits on muscle strength, increases muscle quality and architecture, and is associated with muscle hypertrophy in healthy older adults. Nonetheless, given the shortcomings affecting primary research in terms of the limited number of studies and the high risk of bias, further research is warranted."

Increasing evidence suggests that impaired macroautophagy/autophagy contributes to the development of sarcopenia. However, the mechanisms leading to reduced autophagy during aging remain largely unexplored, and whether autophagy activation protects from sarcopenia has not been fully addressed. Here we show that the autophagy regulator TP53INP2/TRP53INP2 is decreased during aging in mouse and human skeletal muscle. Importantly, chronic activation of autophagy by muscle-specific overexpression of TRP53INP2 prevents sarcopenia and the decline of muscle function in mice. Acute re-expression of TRP53INP2 in aged mice also improves muscle atrophy, enhances mitophagy, and reduces ROS production. In humans, high levels of TP53INP2 in muscle are associated with increased muscle strength and healthy aging. Our findings highlight the relevance of an active muscle autophagy in the maintenance of muscle mass and prevention of sarcopenia.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ATG7: autophagy related 7; BMI: body mass index; EIF4EBP1: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TP53INP2: tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 2; WT: wild type."

In particular, consistent and robust data show the loss of muscle mass, that is, sarcopenia, is clinically relevant since it is closely related to increased morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals and patients. Sarcopenia is defined as the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. International study groups have recently proposed separate definitions and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. Unfortunately, the rate of agreement in assessing the prevalence of sarcopenia is just fair, which highlights the need for a common effort to harmonize definitions and diagnostic criteria. Sarcopenia should be distinct from myopenia, which is the disease-associated loss of muscle mass, although in clinical practice it may be impossible to separate them (i.e., in old cancer patients). The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and multifactorial. Consequently, its treatment should target the different factors involved, including quantitatively and qualitatively inappropriate food intake and reduced physical activity."

It was officially recognized as a disease in 2016 with an ICD-10-CM disease code, M62.84, in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). With the new definitions, there are many studies emerging to investigate the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, exploring new interventions to treat sarcopenia and evaluating the efficacy of combination treatments for sarcopenia.

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive muscle disease characterized by loss of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance with high prevalence in chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is associated with decreased muscle protein synthesis and muscle breakdown due to a number of factors including, the uremic inflammatory environment of the disease. CKD patients are highly sedentary and at risk of malnutrition which may exacerbate sarcopenia outcomes even further. Short and long-term exercise and nutritional interventions have been studied and found to have some positive effects on sarcopenia measures in CKD. This narrative review summarized evidence between 2010 and 2020 of resistance exercise (RE) alone or combined with nutritional interventions for improving sarcopenia outcomes in CKD. Due to lack of CKD-specific sarcopenia measures, the second European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) definition has been used to guide the selection of the studies. The literature search identified 14 resistance exercise-based studies and 5 nutrition plus RE interventional studies. Muscle strength outcomes were increased with longer intervention duration, intervention supervision, and high participant adherence. Data also suggested that CKD patients may require increased RE intensity and progressive loading to obtain detectable results in muscle mass. Unlike muscle strength and muscle mass, physical performance was readily improved by all types of exercise in long or short-term interventions. Four studies used RE with high-protein nutritional supplementation. These showed significant benefits on muscle strength and physical performance in dialysis patients while non-significant results were found in muscle mass. More research is needed to confirm if a combination of RE and vitamin D supplementation could act synergistically to improve muscle strength in CKD. The current evidence on progressive RE for sarcopenia in CKD is encouraging; however, real-life applications in clinical settings are still very limited. A multidisciplinary patient-centred approach with regular follow-up may be most beneficial due to the complexity of sarcopenia in CKD. Long-term randomized control trials are needed to verify optimal RE prescription and explore safety and efficacy of other nutritional interventions in CKD."

The literature search was on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central, restricted to articles published in the last 10 years (2012-2022). Twelve RCTs with a total of 1337 subjects were included. BCAA with vitamin D significantly ameliorates appendicular muscle mass (4 RCTs), hand grip strength (4 RCTs), gait speed (3 RCTs), short physical performance battery (3 RCTs) or chair stand test (3 RCTs) among six out of nine RCTs. BCAA alone (2 RCTs) or PUFA (1 RCT) were not effective in improving muscle health. Mitochondrial function was significantly improved by the administration of BCAA alone (1 RCT) or in association with vitamin D (1 RCT).

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterized by a decline in muscle strength, generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass, and impaired physical performance, which are common outcomes used to screen, diagnose, and determine severity of sarcopenia in older adults. These outcomes are associated with poor quality of life, increased risk of falls, hospitalization, and mortality in this population. The development of sarcopenia is underpinned by aging, but other factors can lead to sarcopenia, such as chronic diseases, physical inactivity, inadequate dietary energy intake, and reduced protein intake (nutrition-related sarcopenia), leading to an imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown. Protein digestion and absorption are also modified with age, as well as the reduced capacity of metabolizing protein, hindering older adults from achieving ideal protein consumption (i.e., 1-1.5 g/kg/day). Nutritional supplement strategies, like animal (i.e., whey protein) and plant-based protein, leucine, and creatine have been shown to play a significant role in improving outcomes related to sarcopenia. However, the impact of other supplements (e.g., branched-chain amino acids, isolated amino acids, and omega-3) on sarcopenia and related outcomes remain unclear. This narrative review will discuss the evidence of the impact of these nutritional strategies on sarcopenia outcomes in older adults."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a progressive disease characterized by a decline in muscle strength, quality, and mass, affects aging population worldwide, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Besides resistance exercise, various nutritional strategies, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation, have been sought to prevent this condition. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence on the effect and mechanism of n-3 PUFA on musculoskeletal health. Despite conflicting evidence, n-3 PUFA is suggested to benefit muscle mass and volume, with more evident effects with higher supplementation dose (>2 g/day). n-3 PUFA supplementation likely improves handgrip and quadriceps strength in the elderly. Improved muscle functions, measured by walking speed and time-up-to-go test, are also observed, especially with longer duration of supplementation (>6 months), although the changes are small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Lastly, n-3 PUFA supplementation may positively affect muscle protein synthesis response to anabolic stimuli, alleviating age-related anabolic resistance. Proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA supplementation improves muscle health include 1. anti-inflammatory properties, 2. augmented expression of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, 3. decreased intracellular protein breakdown, 4. improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function, 5. enhanced amino acid transport, and 6. modulation of neuromuscular junction activity. In conclusion, n-3 PUFAs likely improve musculoskeletal health related to sarcopenia, with suggestive effect on muscle mass, strength, physical performance, and muscle protein synthesis. However, the interpretation of the findings is limited by the small number of participants, heterogeneity of supplementation regimens, and different measuring protocols."

Participants (<i>N</i> = 241) with sarcopenia (aged ≥ 60 y) enrolled from 2 centers were randomized into groups undergoing nutrition supplementation (Nutr), physical exercise (Ex), nutrition combined with exercise (Nutr+Ex), or routine consultation for 12 weeks. Muscle-related indicators, grip strength as well as fat-related indicators were compared pre- and post-intervention. The per-protocol analysis showed that all indicators were significantly different between groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Further pairwise comparisons showed that compared with controls, appendicular muscle mass and grip strength were significantly higher in Nutr (<i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.578, 1.475; <i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: 3.614∼9.118), Ex (<i>P</i> = 0.010, 95% CI: 0.157, 1.153; <i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.904, 8.732), and Nutr+Ex (<i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.564, 1.471; <i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: 3.441, 8.907) groups, while fat mass was significantly lower in the Nutr (<i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: -4.676, -2.358) and Nutr+Ex (<i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI: -4.717,-1.790) groups.

OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of resistance exercise program targeting muscle strength and power with and without nutrition supplementation on gait speed, body composition, physical function and quality of life. METHODS: this trial randomized 113 community-dwelling older Chinese adults aged ≥65 and with sarcopenia defined using the Asian Criteria into one of the three groups: exercise program alone, combined-exercise program and nutrition supplement or waitlist control. The exercise program consisted of 90-min group training twice weekly and one-home session weekly for 12 weeks. Participants in the combined group were additionally asked to consume nutrition supplement twice daily for 12 weeks. Both groups were encouraged to keep home exercise after intervention period for another 12 weeks to detect sustained effect. The primary outcome was gait speed. RESULTS: at 12 and 24 weeks, gait speed did not differ significantly between groups. Significant improvement in leg extension, and five-chair stand test occurred in both intervention groups that persisted to 24 weeks. Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly improved in both intervention groups that persisted until 24 weeks only in the combined group. Lower limb muscle and appendicular skeletal muscle mass increased significantly in the combined group but the increase was not sustained to 24 weeks. CONCLUSION: the exercise program with and without nutrition supplementation had no significant effect on the primary outcome of gait speed but improved the secondary outcomes of strength and the five-chair stand test in community-dwelling Chinese sarcopenic older adults.

Among them, a defect by skeletal muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli is to be considered. Common anabolic stimuli/signals in skeletal muscle are hormones (insulin, growth hormones, IGF-1, androgens, and β-agonists such epinephrine), substrates (amino acids such as protein precursors on top, but also glucose and fat, as source of energy), metabolites (such as β-agonists and HMB), various biochemical/intracellular mediators), physical exercise, neurogenic and immune-modulating factors, etc. Each of them may exhibit a reduced effect upon skeletal muscle in ageing. In this article, we overview the role of anabolic signals on muscle metabolism, as well as currently available evidence of resistance, at the skeletal muscle level, to anabolic factors, from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Some indications on how to augment the effects of anabolic signals on skeletal muscle are provided."

This condition is associated with physical disability, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Therefore, reducing the prevalence of sarcopenia could significantly lower healthcare costs. Sarcopenia can be classified into primary and secondary sarcopenia. The former is related to aging and begins after the fourth decade of life; after that, there is a muscle loss of around 8% per decade until age 70 years, which subsequently increases to 15% per decade. On the other hand, secondary sarcopenia can affect all individuals and may result from various factors including physical inactivity, malnutrition, endocrine disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, and cachexia. Understanding the multiple mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of sarcopenia allows for us to develop strategies that can prevent, treat, or at least mitigate muscle loss caused by increased protein breakdown. One potential treatment of sarcopenia is based on nutritional interventions, including adequate caloric and protein intake and specific nutrients that support muscle health. Such nutrients include natural food rich in whey protein and omega-3 fatty acids as well as nutritional supplements like branched-chain amino acids, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, and vitamin D along with food for special medical purposes. It is important to emphasize that physical exercises, especially resistance training, not only promote muscle protein synthesis on their own but also work synergistically with nutritional strategies to enhance their effectiveness."

After the interventions, we obtained differences in skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass/height2, skeletal muscle mass/weight, muscle mass/BMI, and skeletal muscle mass/body fat percentage (p < 0.05). Changes in average daily energy and total daily protein intakes were not significantly different; however, there was an overall improvement in the intervention groups relative to baseline data. There were no changes in the average daily time of moderate physical activity. The Internet was an effective tool of nutrition intervention in the elderly with sarcopenia.

The dietary inflammatory index (DII®) is a tool designed to assess the inflammatory potential of the diet. The available data on the association between DII and sarcopenia are limited. We aimed to investigate the association of the DII with components of sarcopenia in individuals over 50 years of age. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 dataset. Body composition was measured, and isokinetic strength of the knee extensors (peak force) was evaluated. Low muscle mass and strength were defined using sex-specific thresholds. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII™) scores were calculated using 24-h dietary recall data. Regression models were fit to evaluate the association between E-DII scores and low muscle mass and low muscle strength, alone and combined. RESULTS: Mean age of study participants was 62.1 ± 9.5 years, and 138 participants (7.4%) belonged to the combination group of low muscle mass and low muscle strength. In multivariable-adjusted regression models, higher E-DII score was associated with lower appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) (β =  - 0.03, P  < 0.001, P trend <0.001), and lower peak force (β =  -2.15, P  = 0.04, P trend = 0.01) and higher likelihood for these components combined (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Higher E-DII score is associated with lower muscle mass and muscle strength, and increased likelihood for the combination of low muscle mass and low muscle strength in older adults. This has important implications for healthy aging."

We assessed the efficacy of leucine administration to evaluate whether the regular intake of this essential amino acid can improve muscle mass, muscle strength and functional performance and respiratory muscle function in institutionalized older individuals. The study was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind design in fifty participants aged 65 and over (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03831399). The participants were randomized to a parallel group intervention of 13 weeks' duration with a daily intake of leucine (6 g/day) or placebo (lactose, 6 g/day). The primary outcome was to study the effect on sarcopenia and respiratory muscle function. The secondary outcomes were changes in the geriatric evaluation scales, such as cognitive function, functional impairment and nutritional assessments. We also evaluated whether leucine administration alters blood analytical parameters and inflammatory markers. Administration of leucine was well-tolerated and significantly improves some criteria of sarcopenia in elderly individuals such as functional performance measured by walking time (<i>p</i> = 0.011), and improved lean mass index. For respiratory muscle function, the leucine-treated group improved significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.026) in maximum static expiratory force compared to the placebo. No significant effects on functional impairment, cognitive function or nutritional assessment, inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha were observed after leucine administration compared to the placebo.

Here I reviewed published articles about the effects of nutritional factors on sarcopenia in elderly people. A growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic factors associated with obesity and diabetes induce the progression of sarcopenia. However, the effectiveness and safety of caloric restriction for sarcopenia remained unclear. Protein intake and physical activity are the main anabolic stimuli for muscle protein synthesis. As optimal dietary protein intake, 1.0 - 1.2 g/kg (body weight)/day with an optimal repartition over each daily meal or 25 - 30 g of high quality protein per meal were recommended to prevent sarcopenia, which was supported by some observational studies. Protein supplementation using cheese and milk protein, essential amino acids, leucine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate and vitamin D has been investigated as a potential supplement to improve muscle quality in sarcopenic elderly people."

METHODS: We conducted an eight-wk, two-parallel group intervention, randomized controlled, blinded outcome assessment among 44 post-stroke older patients with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was defined as a loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. The intervention group (n = 21) received a leucine-enriched amino acid supplement; the control group (n = 23) did not. Both groups performed low-intensity resistance training in addition to a post-stroke rehabilitation program. A primary outcome of physical function by using the motor domain of Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and secondary outcomes of appendicular muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass index [SMI]) measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis and muscle strength as handgrip strength were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: The FIM score increased significantly in both groups over time (P < 0.01), with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.045). Handgrip strength also increased significantly over time (P <0.05), with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group (P < 0.01). The SMI increased significantly in the intervention group but not in the control group over time, with significantly greater improvement in the intervention group (median estimated difference, 0.50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-2.11). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that an eight-wk intervention consisting of a leucine-enriched amino acid supplementation and low-intensity resistance training increased muscle mass, strength, and physical function in post-stroke patients with sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) infection is a life-threatening infection caused by certain bacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. More than 10 million subjects are newly sick from this infection every year globally. At the same time, TB is quite prevalent among subjects who come from lower socioeconomic layers of general population, and marginalized sections and areas. Sarcopenia is a muscle disease that derives from adverse muscle alterations and is related to the loss of muscle strength and mass. It is a major medical issue due to its increased adverse outcomes including falls, functional decline, frailty, hospitalizations, increased mortality, and healthcare costs. METHODS: This study examined the potential interplay between the TB infection and sarcopenia through conducting a non-systematic review of the current literature. RESULTS: It has been recorded that the prevalence of sarcopenia among TB survivors is high, whilst the danger of TB among the elderly increases with sarcopenia and physical inactivity. Nevertheless, sufficient protein and total energy intake are associated with a low risk of sarcopenia in TB survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to validate these findings and shed more light on the upcoming different aspects of this intriguing association."

However, the underlying mechanisms for their associations and relationships are less well understood. The <i>App</i>, a Mendelian gene for early-onset AD, encodes amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein enriched at both the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, in this review, we highlight APP and its family members' physiological functions and Swedish mutant APP (APP<sub>swe</sub>)'s pathological roles in muscles and NMJ. Understanding APP's pathophysiological functions in muscles and NMJ is likely to uncover insights not only into neuromuscular diseases but also AD. We summarize key findings from the burgeoning literature, which may open new avenues to investigate the link between muscle cells and brain cells in the development and progression of AD and sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is associated with adverse outcomes such as physical disability, impaired quality of life and increased mortality. Several mechanisms are involved in the development of sarcopenia. Potentially modifiable factors include nutrition and physical activity. Protein metabolism is central to the nutritional issues, along with other potentially modifying nutritional factors as energy balance and vitamin D status. An increasing but still incomplete knowledge base has generated recent recommendations on an increased protein intake in the elderly. Several factors beyond the total amount of protein consumed emerge as potentially important in this context. A recent summit examined three hypotheses: (1) A meal threshold; habitually consuming 25-30 g protein at breakfast, lunch and dinner provides sufficient protein to effectively stimulate muscle protein anabolism; (2) Protein quality; including high-quality protein at each meal improves postprandial muscle protein synthesis; and (3) performing physical activity in close temporal proximity to a high-quality protein meal enhances muscle anabolism. Optimising the potential for muscle protein anabolism by consuming an adequate amount of high-quality protein at each meal, in combination with physical activity, appears as a promising strategy to prevent or delay the onset of sarcopenia. However, results of interventions are inconsistent, and well-designed, standardised studies evaluating exercise or nutrition interventions are needed before guidelines can be developed for the prevention and treatment of age-related sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding sarcopenia is becoming increasingly important as society ages. This comprehensive review covers the definition, epidemiology, causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, management, and future directions for the management of sarcopenia, and the major issues related to sarcopenia in the knee joint. MAIN TEXT: Sarcopenia, a condition related to aging, is characterized by decreased muscle mass and strength, which significantly affects physical function. Its prevalence may vary by region and age, with reports of up to 50% prevalence in the elderly population. The potential causes of sarcopenia include neurodegeneration, poor nutrition, changes in hormonal effects, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced activation of muscle satellite cells. Various pathogeneses, such as apoptosis, proteolysis, and inhibition of the signaling for increasing muscle mass, contribute to the development of sarcopenia. Generally, the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia are based on reduced muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, and decreased physical performance, and can be assessed using various equipment and clinical tests. A healthy lifestyle consisting of a balanced diet, sufficient protein intake, and regular exercise is recommended to prevent sarcopenia. The management of sarcopenia involves resistance exercise, proper nutrition, and deprescribing from polypharmacy. In the future, pharmacological treatment and personalized nutrition may become alternative management options for sarcopenia. Finally, since sarcopenia can be associated with knee osteoarthritis and poor outcomes after total knee arthroplasty, appropriate management of sarcopenia is important for physicians treating knee-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a significant pathological condition that needs to be recognized, especially in the older population. Although sarcopenia is common as aging occurs, it can be prevented by a healthy lifestyle. Currently, there are no approved drugs for sarcopenia; however, resistance exercise and proper nutritional supplementation are essential methods for managing sarcopenic conditions. Given its diverse causes, a personalized approach may be necessary to effectively manage sarcopenia. Finally, appropriate management of sarcopenia can contribute to the prevention and effective treatment of knee osteoarthritis."

RECENT FINDINGS: The evolution over time of the definitions of sarcopenia is discussed, with a focus on the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) definition and the Sarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes Consortium (SDOC) conference. The EWGSOP2 and the SDOC agree on the overall concept of sarcopenia, which involves both impaired function (low muscle strength) and structural damage (low muscle mass/quality). However, physical performance is considered as a diagnostic criterion (EWGSOP), a severity grading assessment (EWGSOP2) or an outcome (SDOC) pending on the definition used. Muscle strength has been recognized as the best predictor of health outcomes. Muscle mass alone, as part of the definition of cachexia, sarcopenia and malnutrition, is a nondefining parameter. Furthermore, there is a lack of precision in measurement techniques and variability of the cut-off points in defining it. SUMMARY: We discuss the relationship of sarcopenia with cachexia, malnutrition and frailty, and the areas that are hampering agreement. We summarize key scientific evidence, consider future study of this nutrition-related disease and raise concern about the need for a universal definition of sarcopenia."

Focusing on muscle strength as the key component of sarcopenia, the aim of this overview was to evaluate its links to nutrition, both to variation in habitual diets in older populations, as well as considering supplementation effects in trials. A main message from the reviewed studies is that while many provide suggestive evidence of benefits of higher nutrient intakes and diets of higher quality, findings are inconsistent, and data on muscle strength are often lacking. To assess the potential of optimising diets as a strategy to promote and maintain muscle strength, gaps in current evidence need to be addressed. These include the need for (i) better understanding of individual differences in responsiveness to dietary change, and the need for targeted nutritional support; (ii) clearer distinction between protective and therapeutic actions of diet; and (iii) definition of the role of dietary patterns and their influence on muscle strength, to allow effects of changes in food consumption to be evaluated-particularly when combined with physical activity. Development of this evidence is needed to enable translation into appropriate dietary recommendations for older populations."

The serum ammonia level is closely associated with sarcopenia regarding ammonia, a key regulator in the liver-muscle axis. In addition, various changes in energy metabolism and hormones are also involved in sarcopenia. The psoas muscle area can represent the overall skeletal muscle mass in liver disease patients. Therefore, measuring the psoas muscle area with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is considered an objective and reliable method for assessing muscle mass. Providing sufficient calorie and protein intake is crucial for preventing and treating sarcopenia. In addition, engaging in appropriate exercise and addressing concurrent hormonal and metabolic changes can be helpful."

Inflammation, changes in nutrient absorption and gut dysbiosis are common conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These factors may lead to variations in macro- and micronutrients and, particularly, to an imbalance of protein metabolism, loss of muscle mass and development of sarcopenia. This narrative review aims to present the set of factors with impact in muscle strength and physical performance that may potentially mediate the relation between inflammatory bowel disease and sarcopenia. Studies that associated changes in muscle strength, sarcopenia and inflammatory bowel disease were selected through a literature search in databases Medline, Pubmed and Scielo using relevant keywords: muscle strength, physical performance, sarcopenia and inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic inflammation is currently reported as a determinant factor in the development of muscle atrophy in inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, strength decline in inflammatory bowel disease patients may be also influenced by changes in body composition and by gut dysbiosis. Measures of muscle strength and physical performance should be considered in the initial identification of sarcopenia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, for a timely intervention can be provided. Presence of proinflammatory cytokines, high adiposity, malabsorption and consequent deficits of macro and micronutrients, loss of muscle mass, and gut dysbiosis may be the main factors with impact in muscle strength, that probably mediate the relation between inflammatory bowel disease and sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related condition associated with a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. Insufficient protein intake is a risk factor for sarcopenia. Protein supplementation is suggested to improve muscle anabolism and function in younger and older adults. Dairy products are a good source of high-quality proteins. This review evaluates the effectiveness of dairy proteins on functions associated with sarcopenia in middle-aged and older adults. Randomized controlled trials were identified using PubMed, CINAHL/EBSCO, and Web of Science databases (last search: 10 May 2017) and were quality assessed. The results of appendicular muscle mass and muscle strength of handgrip and leg press were pooled using a random-effects model. The analysis of the Short Physical Performance Battery is presented in narrative form. Adverse events and tolerability of dairy protein supplementation were considered as secondary outcomes. Fourteen studies involving 1424 participants aged between 61 and 81 y met the inclusion criteria. Dairy protein significantly increased appendicular muscle mass (0.13 kg; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.26 kg; P = 0.04); however, it had no effect on improvement in handgrip (0.84 kg; 95% CI: -0.24, 1.93 kg; P = 0.13) or leg press (0.37 kg; 95% CI: -4.79, 5.53 kg; P = 0.89). The effect of dairy protein on the Short Physical Performance Battery was inconclusive. Nine studies reported the dairy protein to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Although future high-quality research is required to establish the optimal type of dairy protein, the present systematic review provides evidence of the beneficial effect of dairy protein as a potential nutrition strategy to improve appendicular muscle mass in middle-aged and older adults."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is recognized as a crucial factor impacting the prognosis, treatment responses, and quality of life of HNC patients. This review discusses various mechanisms, including common etiological factors, such as aging, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. Cancer-related factors, including tumor locations and treatment modalities, contribute to the development of sarcopenia. The clinical implications of sarcopenia in HNC patients extend beyond reduced muscle strength; it affects overall mobility, reduces quality of life, and increases the risk of falls and fractures. Sarcopenia serves as an independent predictor of postoperative complications, chemotherapy dose-limiting toxicity, and treatment outcomes, which affect therapy planning and perioperative management decisions. Methods to assess sarcopenia in HNC patients encompass various techniques. A sarcopenia assessment offers a potentially efficient and readily available tool for clinical practice. Interventions and management strategies for sarcopenia involve exercise interventions as a cornerstone; however, challenges arise due to patient-specific limitations during cancer treatment. A routine body composition analysis is proposed as a valuable addition to HNC patient management, with ongoing research required to refine preoperative exercise and nutrition programs for improved treatment outcomes and survival."

To emerge preventive strategies, a better understanding is required of life style factors that impacts on sarcopenia. However, since muscle mass and strength in later life depend on both the rate of muscle loss and the peak achieved in early life, attempts to prevent sarcopenia also require considering diet through the life course and the potential benefits of early interventions. Optimizing diet and nutrition status during the life may be an important strategy to preventing sarcopenia and enhancing physical ability in older age."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, which may result in increased physical frailty and a higher risk of adverse events. Low-grade systemic inflammation, loss of muscle protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced number and function of satellite cells seem to be the key points for the induction of muscle wasting, contributing to the pathophysiological mechanisms of sarcopenia. While a range of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors has been reported to contribute to the onset of sarcopenia, dietary interventions targeting protein or antioxidant intake may have a positive effect in increasing muscle mass and strength, regulating protein homeostasis, oxidative reaction, and cell autophagy, thus providing a cellular lifespan extension. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs, which control gene expression in different tissues. In skeletal muscle, a range of miRNAs, named myomiRNAs, are involved in many physiological processes, such as growth, development, and maintenance of muscle mass and function. This review aims to present and to discuss some of the most relevant molecular mechanisms related to the pathophysiological effect of sarcopenia. Besides, we explored the role of nutrition as a possible way to counteract the loss of muscle mass and function associated with ageing, with special attention paid to nutrient-dependent miRNAs regulation. This review will provide important information to better understand sarcopenia and, thus, to facilitate research and therapeutic strategies to counteract the pathophysiological effect of ageing."

Data regarding its clinical significance and consequences in the course of liver disease have been growing; many of the data support the idea that it impacts decompensation event frequency, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality, as well as providing the possibility to better prioritize patients on lists awaiting liver transplantation. When assessing the whole clinical scope of the field, which includes malnutrition and frailty, as well as the complete spectrum of muscle mass, strength, and function, it becomes clear that a well-founded approach in everyday clinical practice is essential. In this respect, this article attempts to unveil the most recently published data regarding possible methods and modalities that could be used to diagnose sarcopenia as early as possible, along with the required accuracy and reliability. From the most important field discoveries to data that need further clarification, the merits and weaknesses of the very diverse existing evaluation methods are presented. Finally, a critical overview is given, in an attempt to discern study lines of importance from those that could pose further ambiguity for the theme. The author also poses relevant questions that remain unanswered but are of clinical importance in the field."

It affects negatively quality of life and it represents a risk factor for other pathologies, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. No silver bullet exists to hinder sarcopenia, but it may be counteracted by physical exercise, nutrition, and a proper endocrine milieu. Indeed, we aim to analyze the scientific literature to give to clinician effective advices to counteract sarcopenia. Main text: Physical exercise, proper nutrition, optimized hormonal homeostasis represent the three pillars to fight sarcopenia. Physical exercise represents the most effective remedy to face sarcopenia, in particular if it is combined with a proper diet and with an adequate endocrine milieu. Consistency in training, adequate daily protein intake and eugonadism seems to be the keys to fight sarcopenia. The combination of these three pillars might act synergistically. CONCLUSIONS: Optimization of these factors may increase their efficiency; however, scientific data may be sometimes confusing so far. Therefore, we aim to give practical advices to clinician to identify and to highlight the most important aspects in each of these three factors that should be addressed."

Low protein intake and loss of muscle mass and function, termed sarcopenia, are indicators of a poor outcome. CLF patients, therefore, should be screened for risk of malnutrition using a validated tool, and if positive, full assessment of nutritional status is mandatory including search for sarcopenia. The main goal of nutritional intervention is to provide enough protein (1.2-1.5 g × kg<sup>-1</sup> × day<sup>-1</sup>) and to ensure adequate energy intake (total energy 30 kcal × kg<sup>-1</sup> × day<sup>-1</sup>; 1.3 × resting energy expenditure). Livers of CLF patients are deplete in glycogen and, therefore, prolonged periods of fasting (>12 h) must be avoided in order to prevent further breakdown of muscle protein for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, late evening snacks or even nocturnal oral nutritional supplements improve total body -protein status and thus, are recommended. Nutrition intervention should be stepped up from nutrition counselling to oral nutritional supplements, to enteral tube feeding, or to parenteral nutrition as appropriate. As in other malnourished patients, the prevention of refeeding syndrome or vitamin/trace element deficiency should be taken care of."

However, complex nutritional composition may affect the effect of treatment. Herein, the pathogenesis of sarcopenia is first introduced. Then, the diagnostic methods of sarcopenia are described in detail, including grip strength, chair stand test, dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, gait speed, balance tests, and biomarkers. Then, the latest progress of the nutritional support (including protein quantity and quality, bioactive peptides, amino acids and their metabolites, antioxidant/ anti-inflammatory nutrients, vitamins and minerals, microbiome-targeted interventions, metabolite-derived molecules, and Chinese herbal medicine) on the mitigation of sarcopenia is elaborated. This review may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism and importance of diagnosis and nutritional support in alleviating sarcopenia, so as to promote the development of sarcopenia treatment."

This study aims to systematically identify biomarkers with potential diagnostic significance for sarcopenia, as well as those exhibiting correlations with sarcopenia, particularly biomarkers reporting quantitative pooled data. METHODS: This umbrella review adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Data sources including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from the inception of data to April 7, 2025. The AMSTAR 2 tool and QUADAS-2 tool was utilized to assess the methodological quality of including studies, while the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence in these studies. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were included. The identified biomarkers encompass inflammatory, metabolic, hormonal, amino acid-related, genetic, and other categories. The evidence quality for most biomarkers was rated as very low. The creatinine to cystatin C (Cr/CysC) ratio emerged as the most frequently utilized diagnostic biomarker, demonstrating moderate diagnostic accuracy. However, its diagnostic performance exhibited variability across different diagnostic criteria. Biomarkers associated with sarcopenia predominantly demonstrated weak or negligible inverse correlations. Inflammatory biomarkers underwent the most comprehensive investigation. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels compared to controls, with these markers showing post-intervention improvement. Some metabolic and amino acid biomarkers were found to be lower in patients with sarcopenia than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The Cr/CysC ratio demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and represents the most frequently utilized diagnostic biomarker for sarcopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers constitute the predominant biomarkers and exhibit general elevation in sarcopenia patients. Following sarcopenia interventions, alterations in biomarker expression levels are observed, suggesting novel therapeutic applications for these biomarkers."

Recent studies on sarcopenia and frailty in ICU patients are presented in this review, aiming to identify accurate diagnostic tools, investigate the effects on clinical and functional outcomes, and propose possible effective interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent change of the sarcopenia definition underlines the importance of muscle strength over mass, this is however challenging to assess in ICU patients. There is currently no unified sarcopenia definition, nor standard frailty assessment tool; Clinical Frailty Scale is most frequently used in the ICU. Meta-analyses show worse clinical and functional outcomes for frail as well as sarcopenic patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of admission diagnosis. Frailty is a dynamic condition, worsening in severity by the time of hospital discharge, but showing improvement by 6 months post-ICU. Therapeutic interventions for frailty and sarcopenia remain limited. Although mobilization strategies show promise in improving functional and cognitive outcomes, inconsistent outcomes are reported. Heterogeneity in definitions, patient populations, and care practices challenge interpretation and comparison of study results and recognition of beneficial interventions. This highlights the need for more research. SUMMARY: The importance of preexisting sarcopenia and frailty is recognized in ICU patients and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Multidimensional interventions are most promising, including patient-tailored mobilization and nutrition."

Inadequate nutritional intakes and physical activity, together with endocrine disturbances are associated with of sarcopenia and frailty. Guidelines from scientific societies mainly address the quantitative aspects of protein and energy nutrition in elderly. Besides these quantitative aspects of protein load, perspective strategies to promote muscle protein synthesis and prevent sarcopenia include pulse feeding, the use of fast proteins and the addition of leucine or citrulline to dietary protein. An integrated management of sarcopenia, taking into account the determinants of muscle wasting, i.e. nutrition, physical activity, anabolic factors such as androgens, vitamin D and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids status, needs to be tested in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. The importance of physical activity, specifically resistance training, is emphasized, not only in order to facilitate muscle protein anabolism but also to increase appetite and food intake in elderly people at risk of malnutrition. According to present data, healthy nutrition in elderly should respect the guidelines for protein and energy requirement, privilege a Mediterranean way of alimentation, and be associated with a regular physical activity. Further issues relate to the identification of the genetics determinants of protein energy wasting in elderly."

Several conditions have a role in its pathogenesis, significantly impacting adverse outcomes such as falls, functional decline, frailty, disability, multiple hospitalizations, and mortality. In the oncological setting, sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of treatment toxicity, postoperative complications, and a higher mortality rate related to other causes (e.g., pneumonia). In the hematological field, even more so, sarcopenia predicts toxicity and response to treatments. In patients with hematologic malignancy, low muscle mass is associated with adverse outcomes and is a predictor of overall survival and non-relapse mortality. Therefore, it is essential to correctly recognize sarcopenia, evaluate the risk factors and their impact on the patient's trajectory, and effectively treat sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a reversible condition. The most effective intervention for reversing it is physical exercise combined with nutrition. The objective of clinical assessment focused on sarcopenia is to be able to carry out a \"tailor-made treatment\"."

This review focuses on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and early detection of elderly sarcopenia. As far as treatment is concerned, physical activity and nutritional support are specifically evaluated. An individually tailored resistance exercise training program appears to be crucial for a positive outcome of the sarcopenia prevention and treatment. The nutritional intervention is mostly based on the supplementation with high-quality proteins (i.e., whey protein) in order to increase the intake of essential amino acids and in particular of leucine. In addition, of relevant importance appears to be the supplementation with vitamin D, with omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics. This review evaluates the results of the most qualified studies on the nutritional supplementation of sarcopenic elderly subjects and shows that promising results have been achieved in community elderly subjects, or subjects followed in rehabilitation centers and in nursing homes, with additional resistance exercise programs."

This literature review aims to clarify how and why to measure and preserve muscle strength in older population. Overall, the relationship between muscle strength and physical function is impacted by level of muscle mass, the degree of obesity (BMI), age and physical activity. Therefore, these factors are to be considered in the evaluation of muscle strength. It is necessary to have objective, reliable and sensitive tools to assess muscle strength, in different populations to detect and quantify weakness, to adapt physical exercises to patients' capacity and to evaluate the effects of treatment. Handgrip strength measurement might be reasonable for clinical practice while the measurement of knee flexors/extensors strength with both 1RM and dynamometers is increasingly important yet restricted by the requirement of special equipment. Physical activity and nutrition are two important behavioral factors to maintain muscle strength. Combined exercise and nutrition interventions improved muscle strength to a more prominent degree than exercise or nutrition alone."

The study aimed to determine the associations of muscle parameters (muscle mass, strength, quality, and sarcopenia) and sarcopenia obesity with diabetes, and the previously unstudied mediating effect of inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13,420 adults from the 2023 China National Health Survey (CNHS) and 5,380 adults from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in this study. Muscle mass was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in the CNHS, and whole-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the NHANES. Muscle strength was assessed using digital hand dynamometer. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of muscle parameters and sarcopenia obesity with diabetes. Inflammatory status was assessed using blood cell counts and two systemic inflammation indices (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and system inflammation response index (SIRI)). Mediation analysis was conducted to examine inflammation's role in these associations. RESULTS: Low muscle mass and strength were independently related to diabetes. Low muscle quality was associated with elevated diabetes risk. Sarcopenia has a stronger association with diabetes compared to low muscle strength alone or mass alone (CNHS, odds ratio (OR) = 1.93, 95 % confidence interval (CI):1.64-2.27; NHANES, OR = 3.80, 95 %CI:2.58-5.58). Participants with sarcopenia obesity exhibit a higher risk of diabetes than those with obesity or sarcopenia alone (CNHS, OR = 2.21, 95 %CI:1.72-2.84; NHANES, OR = 6.06, 95 %CI:3.64-10.08). Associations between muscle parameters and diabetes were partially mediated by inflammation (mediation proportion: 1.99 %-36.64 %, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Low muscle mass and muscle strength are independently or jointly associated with diabetes, and inflammation might be a potential mechanism underlying this association. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of sarcopenia and obesity could significantly increase diabetes risk."

Sarcopenia, a muscle disease characterised by low muscle strength, mass, and function is associated with an increased risk of functional decline, frailty, hospitalization, and death. The prevalence of sarcopenia increases with age and leads to high personal, social, and economic costs. Finding adequate nutritional measures to maintain muscle health, preserve function, and independence for the growing population of older adults would have important scientific and societal implications. Two main approaches have been employed to study the role of diet/DPs as a modifiable lifestyle factor in sarcopenia. An a priori or hypothesis-driven approach examines the adherence to pre-defined dietary indices such as the Mediterranean diet (MED) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-measures of diet quality-in relation to muscle health outcomes. A posteriori or data-driven approaches have used statistical tools-dimension reduction methods or clustering-to study DP-muscle health relationships. Both approaches recognise the importance of the whole diet and potential cumulative, synergistic, and antagonistic effects of foods and nutrients on ageing muscle. In this review, we have aimed to (i) summarise nutritional epidemiology evidence from four recent systematic reviews with updates from new primary studies about the role of DPs in muscle health, sarcopenia, and its components; (ii) hypothesise about the potential mechanisms of 'myoprotective' diets, with the MED as an example, and (iii) discuss the challenges facing nutritional epidemiology to produce the higher level evidence needed to understand the relationships between whole diets and healthy muscle ageing."

Although the individual and economic costs of sarcopenia are widely recognised, current understanding of its pathophysiology is incomplete, limiting efforts to translate research evidence into effective preventive and treatment strategies. While nutrition is a key field of sarcopenia research, the role of differences in habitual diets, and the effectiveness of dietary change as a prevention or treatment strategy, is uncertain. There is a growing evidence base that links low micronutrient intakes to sarcopenia risk and/or its components (low muscle strength and mass, impaired physical performance), although there remain many gaps in understanding. There is some consistency in findings across studies highlighting potential roles for antioxidant nutrients, B vitamins and magnesium; however, the evidence is largely observational and from cross-sectional studies, often describing associations with different muscle outcomes. As low intakes of some micronutrients are common in older populations, there is a need for new research, particularly from well-characterised prospective cohorts, to improve the understanding of their role and importance in the aetiology of sarcopenia and to generate the evidence needed to inform dietary guidelines to promote muscle health."

This demographic shift underscores the growing prevalence of sarcopenia, a progressive skeletal muscle disorder related to aging, characterized by reduced muscle mass, strength, and function, which significantly affects the morbidity and quality of life of older adults. Although sarcopenia is defined as a medical condition (ICD-10-CM M62.84; KCD-8 M62.5), no effective pharmacological treatment exists, emphasizing the importance of non-pharmacological prevention and management strategies. Definitions of sarcopenia have been proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), and the Korean Working Group on Sarcopenia (KWGS). The current interventions focus on exercise and nutritional supplementation. Protein intake above the generally recommended dietary allowance, along with resistance exercise, is strongly recommended for the prevention and management of sarcopenia. Asian intervention studies have highlighted the benefits of multimodal programs that combine exercise, nutrition, and geriatric care. However, standardized protocols remain inconclusive. Variations in diagnostic criteria and ethnic differences further complicate the management of sarcopenia. Future large-scale studies are needed to establish effective preventive measures and therapeutic strategies for sarcopenia with a focus on tailored interventions and standardized protocols for Asians."

The purpose of this article is to review the current evidence concerning the epidemiology, diagnosis, management and predictive value of sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Sarcopenia is a frequent and lethal complication of cirrhosis. Currently, abdominal computed tomography imaging is the most commonly used method to diagnose sarcopenia. In clinical practice, assessing muscle strength and physical performance, such as by measuring handgrip strength and gait speed, is of increasing interest. In addition to the necessary pharmacological therapy, adequate intake of protein, energy and micronutrients, as well as regular moderate-intensity exercise, can help to minimize sarcopenia. Sarcopenia has been shown to be a strong predictor of prognosis in patients with severe liver disease. SUMMARY: A global consensus is needed on the definition and operational parameters for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Further research should focus on developing standardized screening, management and treatment protocols for sarcopenia. Adding sarcopenia to existing models may better exploit the effect of sarcopenia on prognosis in patients with cirrhosis, which should be investigated further."

Finding cost-effective prevention and treatment strategies for sarcopenia for the growing ageing population is therefore of great public health interest. Although nutrition is considered an important factor in the aetiology of sarcopenia, its potential for sarcopenia prevention and/or treatment is still being evaluated. Nutrition research for sarcopenia utilises three main approaches to understand muscle-nutrition relationships, evaluating: single nutrients, whole foods and whole diet effects - both alone or combined with exercise. Applying these approaches, we summarise recent evidence from qualitative and quantitative syntheses of findings from observational and intervention studies of healthy older adults, and those with sarcopenia. We consider protein supplements, whole foods (fruits and vegetables) and the Mediterranean diet as exemplars. There is some evidence of beneficial effects of protein supplementation ≥ 0·8 g/kg body weight/d on muscle mass when combined with exercise training in intervention studies of healthy and sarcopenic older adults. In contrast, evidence for effects on muscle function (strength and physical performance) is inconclusive. There is reasonably consistent epidemiological evidence suggesting benefits of higher fruits and vegetables consumption for better physical performance. Similarly, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with beneficial effects on muscle function in observational studies. However, intervention studies are lacking. This review discusses how current evidence may inform the development of preventive and intervention strategies for optimal muscle ageing and nutritional public policy aimed at combatting sarcopenia."

While bone loss has long been recognized as an inevitable consequence of aging, sarcopenia-the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with advancing age-has recently received increased attention. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify nutritional factors that contribute to loss of muscle mass. The role of protein, acid-base balance, vitamin D/calcium, and other minor nutrients like B vitamins was reviewed. Muscle wasting is a multifactorial process involving intrinsic and extrinsic alterations. A loss of fast twitch fibers, glycation of proteins, and insulin resistance may play an important role in the loss of muscle strength and development of sarcopenia. Protein intake plays an integral part in muscle health and an intake of 1.0-1.2 g/kg of body weight per day is probably optimal for older adults. There is a moderate [corrected] relationship between vitamin D status and muscle strength. Chronic ingestion of acid-producing diets appears to have a negative impact on muscle performance, and decreases in vitamin B12 and folic acid intake may also impair muscle function through their action on homocysteine. An adequate nutritional intake and an optimal dietary acid-base balance are important elements of any strategy to preserve muscle mass and strength during aging."

Uremic sarcopenia is related to an increased risk of hospitalization and all-causes mortality. This pathological condition is caused not only by advanced age but also by others factors typical of CKD patients such as metabolic acidosis, hemodialysis therapy, low-grade inflammatory status and inadequate protein-energy intake. Currently, treatments available to ameliorate uremic sarcopenia include nutritional therapy (oral nutritional supplement, inter/intradialytic parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, high protein and fiber diet and percutaneous endoscopic gastrectomy) and a personalized program of physical activity. The aim of this review is to analyze the possible benefits induced by nutritional therapy alone or in combination with a personalized program of physical activity, on onset and/or progression of uremic sarcopenia."

The diagnosis of sarcopenia requires the combined presence of low muscle strength and low muscle mass. Well-established approaches for the prevention and therapy of sarcopenia are exercise programs-in particular strength, endurance and power training-and nutritional interventions, preferably a combination of both. Adequate protein intake is considered highly relevant, while the role of other nutrients involved in muscle metabolism (e. g. creatine, vitamin D, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids) is less clear, being still the subject of controversial discussions. Innovative pharmacological therapies are currently under investigation and their future relevance for this indication is unclear. In general, it has to be stated that there are still only few intervention studies available that focused specifically on sarcopenia in older individuals. More studies in this rapidly increasing population are urgently needed."

No satisfying biomarkers for sarcopenia diagnosis exist, connecting bone, fat and muscle. Matrix-GLA-protein (MGP) is an adipokine that regulates bone metabolism and is associated with decreased muscle strength. Associations of dp-ucMGP were analyzed in the BioPersMed cohort (58 ± 9 years), including 1022 asymptomatic subjects at moderate cardiovascular risk. Serum measurements of dp-ucMGP in 760 persons were performed with the InaKtif MGP Kit with the IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated System. DXA data (792 persons) measured with the Lunar iDXA system and physical performance data (786 persons) were available. Dp-ucMGP plasma levels correlate with sarcopenia parameters like gait speed (ρ = −0.192, p < 0.001), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ρ = 0.102, p = 0.005) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ρ = 0.112, p = 0.001). They are lower in persons with sarcopenia (p < 0.001) and higher in persons with reduced physical performance (p = 0.019). Persons in the lowest dp-ucMGP quartile have the highest risk for reduced muscle mass, decreasing with each quartile, whereas persons in the highest quartile have the highest risk of reduced muscle strength. Dp-ucMGP might be a good biomarker candidate in sarcopenia characterization."

Screening tools may be used to prioritize patients, this can be done using the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 or Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool. Subsequently, a thorough nutrition-focused physical examination should be conducted to evaluate clinical signs of nutrition deficiencies, fat and muscle loss, and fluid overload; dietary history and current intake must also be assessed. Apart from physical examination, specific testing for sarcopenia and frailty are recommended. For sarcopenia assessment, specifically for muscle quantification, the gold standard is the cross-sectional measurement of the muscle at L3 obtained from a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging; dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is also a good tool especially when appendicular skeletal muscle index is calculated. Other more readily available options include phase angle from bioelectrical impedance or bioimpedance spectroscopy. In the sarcopenia assessment, muscle function evaluation is required, handgrip strength stands as the primary test for this purpose; this test is also part of the subjective global assessment and is included in some frailty scores. Finally, for frailty assessment, the Short Physical Performance Battery is useful for evaluating physical frailty, and for a multidimensional evaluation, the Fried frailty phenotype can be used. Specifically for liver transplant candidates, the use of Liver Frailty Index is recommended."

Disturbance in the circadian clock due to shiftwork and chronic jetlag is related to the risk of several disorders such as metabolic syndrome and cancer. Recently, it has been thought that shiftwork increases the risk of sarcopenia which is characterized by age-related decline of muscle mass and its dysfunctions including muscle strength and/or physical performance. First, we summarize the association between circadian rhythm and the occurrence of sarcopenia and discuss its mechanistic insight by focusing on the muscle function and molecular clock gene in knockout or mutant mice. The clock gene knockout or mutant mice showed early aging phenotypes, including low survival rate and muscle loss. It suggests that improvement in the disturbance of the circadian clock plays an important role in the aging process of healthy muscles. Nutritional intake has the potential to augment muscle growth and entrain the peripheral clock. Second, we discuss the potential of chrono-nutrition in preventing aging-related muscle loss and dysfunction. We also focus on the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF) and the distribution of protein intake across three meals."

PURPOSE: This paper reviews: (1) the mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, (2) the impact of age-related changes in muscle composition on 3 processes integral to muscle function, (3) the efficacy of pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter nutritional supplements in the management of sarcopenia, (4) experimental use of pharmaceutical regulation of myostatin to increase muscle mass and strength in animal models, and (5) efficacy of resistance training as a means of maintaining or recovering muscle mass and strength. METHODS: PubMed was searched for relevant research articles using the following descriptors: sarcopenia, aging, muscle mass, muscle performance, muscle strength, myostatin, testosterone, growth hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, hormone replacement, nutrition, resistance training, and endurance training. RESULTS: Sarcopenia is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including alpha-motor neuron death, altered hormone concentrations, increased inflammation, and altered nutritional status. Age-related changes within muscle likely affect processes integral to muscle function. These changes negatively influence muscle performance directly or by contributing to sarcopenia. Pharmaceutical or supplement interventions to treat sarcopenia have not proved encouraging to date, either lacking or providing limited efficacy, along with the potential for negative health consequences. In contrast, resistance training has proven safe and highly effective for increasing muscle mass and strength in aging adults. CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is a multifactorial consequence of aging that will affect many adults. Resistance training is the most effective and safe intervention to attenuate or recover some of the loss of muscle mass and strength that accompanies aging."

The aim of this study was to analyze the current knowledge domain and emerging trends of nutrition-related research in sarcopenia and provide implications for future research and strategies to prevent or manage sarcopenia in the context of aging societies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nutrition- and sarcopenia-related research were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database from its inception to April 1, 2022. Performance analysis, science mapping, and thematic clustering were performed by using the software VOSviewer and R package \"bibliometrix.\" Bibliometric analysis (BA) guideline was applied in this study. RESULTS: A total of 8,110 publications were extracted and only 7,510 (92.60%) were selected for final analysis. The production trend in nutrition and sarcopenia research was promising, and 1,357 journals, 107 countries, 6,668 institutions, and 31,289 authors were identified in this field till 2021. Stable cooperation networks have formed in the field, but they are mostly divided by region and research topics. Health and sarcopenia, metabolism and nutrition, nutrition and exercise, body compositions, and physical performance were the main search themes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides health providers and scholars mapped out a comprehensive basic knowledge structure in the research in the field of nutrition and sarcopenia over the past 30 years. This study could help them quickly grasp research hotspots and choose future research projects."

            "abstract": "Diminished skeletal muscle strength and size, termed sarcopenia, contributes substantially to physical disability, falls, dependence and reduced quality of life among older people. Physical activity and nutrition are the cornerstones of sarcopenia prevention and treatment. The optimal daily protein intake required to preserve muscle mass and function among older adults is a topic of intense scientific debate. Older adults require protein intakes about 67 % higher than their younger counterparts to maximally stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates. In addition, evidence suggests a possible benefit of increasing protein intake above the population reference intake (0⋅83 g/kg/d) on lean mass and, when combined with exercise training, muscle strength. In addition to protein quantity, protein quality, the pattern of protein intake over the day and specific amino acids (i.e. leucine) represent key considerations. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 PUFA (LC <i>n-</i>3 PUFA) supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis rates, increase muscle mass and function and augment adaptations to resistance training in older adults. Yet, these effects are not consistent across all studies. Emerging evidence indicates that an older person's dietary, phenotypic and behavioural characteristics may modulate the efficacy of protein and LC <i>n</i>-3 PUFA interventions for promoting improvements in muscle mass and function, highlighting the potential inadequacy of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. The application of personalised or precision nutrition to sarcopenia represents an exciting and highly novel field of research with the potential to help resolve inconsistencies in the literature and improve the efficacy of dietary interventions for sarcopenia."

In this context, malnutrition, a significant contributor to sarcopenia, is often overlooked among the Indian population. Maintenance of an optimal energy and protein balance with adequate physical activity level is essential to preserve physical function in the aging population. However, research on the role of micronutrients in muscle maintenance, is still in its infancy.

Several risks factors may contribute to the development of SA in the elderly; among them, nutrition plays a key role in muscle health. The elderly are at risk of inadequate intake in terms of micronutrients affecting muscle homeostasis, such as B vitamins, related to homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This narrative review analysed the association between increased Hcy levels and SA, according to the criteria of the International Working Group on Sarcopenia, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People and the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The authors focused not only on SA per se but also on exploring the association between increased Hcy levels and components of SA, including muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. RESULTS: Results are inconsistent, except for muscle mass, showing no significant associations with Hcy levels. CONCLUSIONS: Few and conflicting data emerged in this review on the association between SA and increased Hcy levels due to numerous differences between studies that change the significance of the association of Hcy and SA, as well as the muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. Furthermore, because the ageing process is not uniform in the population owing to differences in genetics, lifestyle and general health, chronological age fails to address the observed heterogeneity among the 'elderly' of the studies reported in this revision. Therefore, further studies are still needed."

Whole foods rich in specific nutrients may be myoprotective and mitigate the risk of sarcopenia. Here we review recent evidence published from observational and intervention studies regarding myoprotective foods and explore their benefit for the prevention and/or treatment of sarcopenia in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: We found limited new evidence for the role of whole foods in sarcopenia and sarcopenia components (muscle mass, strength, physical performance). There was some evidence for higher consumption of protein-rich foods (milk and dairy) being beneficial for muscle strength in observational and intervention studies. Higher consumption of antioxidant-rich foods (fruit and vegetables) was associated with better physical performance and lower odds of sarcopenia in observational studies. Evidence for other protein- and antioxidant-rich foods were inconsistent or lacking. There remains a clear need for intervention studies designed to identify the role of whole foods for the treatment of sarcopenia. SUMMARY: Although evidence for myoprotective roles of dairy, fruit and vegetables is emerging from observational studies, higher level evidence from intervention studies is needed for these foods to be recommended in diets of older adults to prevent and/or treat sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To document recent evidence regarding the role of nutrition as an intervention for sarcopenia. RECENT FINDINGS: A review of seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone on muscle loss in 147 adults showed greater muscle mass gain in the intervention group, but no benefit in muscle strength and physical performance measures. Three other review articles examined nutrition and exercise as combined intervention, and suggest enhancement of benefits of exercise by nutrition supplements (energy, protein, vitamin D). Four trials reported on nutrition alone as intervention, mainly consisting of whey protein, leucine, HMB and vitamin D, with variable results on muscle mass and function. Four trials examined the combined effects of nutrition combined with exercise, showing improvements in muscle mass and function. SUMMARY: To date, evidence suggests that nutrition intervention alone does have benefit, and certainly enhances the impact of exercise. Nutrients include high-quality protein, leucine, HMB and vitamin D. Long-lasting impact may depend on baseline nutritional status, baseline severity of sarcopenia, and long-lasting adherence to the intervention regime. Future large-scale multicentered RCTs using standardized protocols may provide evidence for formulating guidelines on nutritional intervention for sarcopenia. There is a paucity of data for nursing home populations."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life, and death. Primary sarcopenia is considered to be age-related when no other cause is evident, other than ageing itself. Secondary sarcopenia should be considered when one or more other causes are evident, such as activity-, disease-, or nutrition-related sarcopenia. In this narrative review that focused on human studies, we summarize the pharmaceutical therapies (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, estrogen, growth hormone, ghrelin, vitamin D, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and eicosapentaenoic acid) and nonpharmaceutical therapies (resistance training, protein and amino acid supplementation, and non-smoking) for counteracting primary sarcopenia. Testosterone and growth hormone improve muscle mass and muscle strength, but have several side effects. Although there are some intriguing pharmaceutical therapies to combat sarcopenia, resistance training combined with supplements containing amino acids are the most effective for preventing and treating age-related muscle wasting and weakness. The etiology of sarcopenia in the elderly is multi-factorial. Patients with disuse syndrome and deconditioning often complicate the diagnosis, of not only activity-related sarcopenia, but also age-, disease-, and nutrition-related sarcopenia. In these cases a comprehensive approach to sarcopenia treatment should include pharmaceutical therapies for age-related sarcopenia and comorbid chronic diseases, resistance training, early ambulation, nutrition management, protein and amino acid supplementation, and non-smoking. The effect of pharmaceutical therapies for sarcopenia can be enhanced by this comprehensive approach. Future research on pharmaceutical therapies for counteracting sarcopenia should consider non-pharmaceutical therapies and also the causes of sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a condition marked by progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function while frailty is a multidimensional concept characterized by diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. Both of these were previously considered as related to aging and shown to impact the quality of life and carry prognostic significance. Emerging data show that both sarcopenia and frailty carry similar relevance in chronic illness. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and malnourishment, both of which contribute to the development of sarcopenia by increasing protein breakdown and reducing protein synthesis. The coexistence of frailty further compounds the clinical complexity of IBD patients. Published evidence suggests a bidirectional association with IBD contributing to muscle wasting, while the resultant sarcopenia and frailty could further exacerbate the disease course. Sarcopenia and frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes, including hospitalizations, increased surgical interventions, and surgical complications. As therapeutic strategies for IBD evolve, understanding the nuanced relationship between inflammatory bowel disease, sarcopenia, and frailty is crucial for devising holistic management. Comprehensive care should encompass not only disease-modifying therapies but also interventions targeting frailty and sarcopenia, as they have been shown to have a significant impact not only on the disease course but also on the quality of life. Future research could focus on further elucidating underlying mechanisms, simple screening strategies, and developing targeted interventions to improve the overall quality of life for individuals grappling with the complex interplay of IBD, sarcopenia, and frailty."

This review aims to summarize the current literature regarding how nutrition contributes to liver disease, how to screen patients, and what nutritional and activity recommendations can help prevent adverse outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Screening for malnutrition, obesity, and sarcopenia through ambulatory bedside methods is recommended every 8-12 weeks in high risk patients. A Mediterranean diet with emphasis on high protein intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day, and increasing physical activity can help to improve nutritional status. It remains critical to screen and identify patients with liver disease for malnutrition, obesity, and sarcopenia. Identifying an individualized action plan through a multidisciplinary approach can be helpful. Dietary recommendations to improve outcomes should be based on well-studied approaches. These can include the use of the Mediterranean diet in those with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and a high protein diet in those with cirrhosis and sarcopenia. Routine assessment of improvement or decline should continue throughout a patient's clinical course."

Current views consider sarcopenia as the consequence of multiple medical, behavioural and environmental factors that characterize aged individuals. Likewise bone fragility is known to depend on several pathogenetic mechanisms leading to bone mass loss and reduction of bone strength. Muscle weakness, fear of falls, falls and subsequent fractures are associated to concurrent sarcopenia and osteoporosis and lead to restricted mobility, loss of autonomy and reduced life expectancy. The skeletal and the muscular organ systems are tightly intertwined: the strongest mechanical forces applied to bones are, indeed, those created by muscle contractions that condition bone density, strength, and microarchitecture. Not surprising, therefore, the decrease in muscle strength leads to lower bone strength. The degenerative processes leading to osteoporosis and sarcopenia show many common pathogenic pathways, like the sensitivity to reduced anabolic hormone secretion, increased inflammatory cytokine activity and reduced physical activity. Thus they may also respond to the same kind of treatments. Basic is life-style interventions related to exercise and nutrition. Sufficient vitamin D levels are of importance for both bone and muscle, primarily provided by sun exposure at younger age, and by supplementation at older age. Resistance training several times per week is crucial, and to be effective adequate access to energy and proteins is necessary."

To summarize the evidence for the relationships between dietary inflammatory potential and skeletal muscle strength, mass, and sarcopenia in adults we conducted this meta-analysis. METHODS: Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science were searched from inception up to 12 March 2023 for studies that evaluated the associations of dietary inflammatory potential [estimated by the Dietary inflammatory index (DII)] with skeletal muscle strength, mass, and sarcopenia. A meta-analysis was then performed to calculate the pooled regression coefficient (β) and odds ratio (OR). The non-linear dose-response relation between DII and sarcopenia was assessed using random-effects dose-response meta-analysis. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 24 studies involving 56,536 participants. It was found that high DII was associated with low skeletal muscle strength [OR 1.435, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.247-1.651, <i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 4.97%]. There was a negative association of DII with skeletal muscle strength (β-0.031, 95% CI -0.056 to -0.006, <i>P</i> = 0.017, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 72.69%). High DII was also associated with low skeletal muscle mass (OR 1.106, 95% CI 1.058-1.157, <i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%). DII had a negative relationship with skeletal muscle mass with high heterogeneity (β-0.099, 95% CI -0.145 to -0.053, <i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 88.67%); we downgraded the inconsistency in the subgroup analysis of overweight/obese participants (β-0.042, 95% CI -0.065 to -0.019, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 12.54%). Finally, the pooled results suggested that high DII was significantly associated with sarcopenia with significant heterogeneity (OR 1.530, 95% CI 1.245-1.880, <i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 69.46%); age and BMI may contribute partially to the heterogeneity since heterogeneity was decreased in the subgroup of older age (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.232-3.051, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%) and the group of overweight/obesity (OR 1.853, 95% CI 1.398-2.456, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%). There was a non-linear dose-response association between DII and sarcopenia (<i>P</i> = 0.012 for non-linearity). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that higher dietary inflammatory potential was significantly associated with lower skeletal muscle strength, mass, and risk of sarcopenia. Future studies with consistent assessment and standardized methodology are needed for further analysis."

Therefore, seeking effective methods to delay and treat sarcopenia and to improve the quality of life of elderly individuals is a trending topic in geriatrics. Caloric restriction (CR) is currently recognized as an effective means to extend the lifespan and delay the decline in organ function caused by aging. In this review, we describe the effects of CR on improving muscle protein synthesis, delaying muscle atrophy, regulating muscle mitochondrial function, maintaining muscle strength, promoting muscle stem cell (MuSC) regeneration and differentiation, and thus protecting against sarcopenia. We also summarize the possible cellular mechanisms by which CR delays sarcopenia. CR can delay sarcopenia by reducing the generation of oxygen free radicals, reducing oxidative stress damage, enhancing mitochondrial function, improving protein homeostasis, reducing iron overload, increasing autophagy and apoptosis, and reducing inflammation. However, the relationships between CR and genetics, sex, animal strain, regimen duration and energy intake level are complex. Therefore, further study of the proper timing and application method of CR to prevent sarcopenia is highly important for the aging population."

A review was conducted of the recent English literature searching PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review, presenting the results of 671 sarcopenic patients. The exercise interventions were resistance training (four studies), a multimodal program (five studies, encompassing resistance training and additional exercises such as aerobic exercises, flexibility, balance and strength training), and a whole body vibration program (one study). Results show that exercise interventions could have beneficial effects in improving muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in 3 months of intervention. Resistance training, added to an adequate nutrition and aerobic exercise, appeared to deliver the most positive outcome after 3 months of intervention. Types of exercise and dose-response parameters of exercise eliciting improvement warrant further investigation. Due to the significant heterogeneity in clinical trials, the current evidence provides limited guidance. Well-designed studies evaluating exercise interventions are needed before treatment guidelines can be developed."

Recently sarcopenia was recognized as a clinical disease by the International Classification of Disease, 10th revision, Clinical Modification. An imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation causes a gradual loss of muscle mass, resulting in a decline of muscle function as a progress of sarcopenia. Many mechanisms involved in the onset of sarcopenia include age-related factors as well as activity-, disease-, and nutrition-related factors. The stage of sarcopenia reflecting the severity of conditions assists clinical management of sarcopenia. It is important that systemic descriptions of the disease conditions include age, sex, and other environmental risk factors as well as levels of physical function. To develop a new therapeutic intervention needed is the detailed understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms by which apoptosis, autophagy, atrophy, and hypertrophy occur in the muscle stem cells, myotubes, and/or neuromuscular junction. The new strategy to managing sarcopenia will be signal-modulating small molecules, natural compounds, repurposing of old drugs, and muscle-specific microRNAs."

Sarcopenia is a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength or physical function. The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with RA is higher than that in the general population. The treatment and management of sarcopenia in patients with RA are clinically important for long-term prognosis. One of the mechanisms of muscle metabolism is the pro-inflammatory cytokine pathway, which involves tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin-6, and is a common pathway in the pathogenesis of RA. Thus, tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 inhibitors may play a potential role in controlling sarcopenia. In exercise therapy, a combination of moderate resistance and aerobic exercise may be effective in improving muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical function; however, intense exercise may exacerbate the inflammatory response in RA. Regarding nutrition, protein intake is generally considered beneficial, but other nutrients such as vitamin D and carotenoids have also been studied. Overall, there remains a lack of concrete evidence on sarcopenia treatment and management in patients with RA from any perspective; more longitudinal and intervention studies are needed in the future."

AIM: To conduct a systematic review of the paediatric IBD literature on skeletal muscle function and mass and identify interventions that could affect them. METHODS: Systematic searches (EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane library central for registered control trials and Web of Science) were conducted using the terms 'lean body mass' (LM), 'fat free mass' (FFM) or 'MM' and 'IBD'. RESULTS: Fourteenth studies were included, presenting data from 439 Crohn's disease (CD), 139 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 IBD-unclassified participants compared with healthy matched or unmatched groups or reference populations. Six out of 14 studies reported lower LM, whilst 7 studies observed lower MM and FFM in CD patients compared to healthy controls. Research in UC patients reported lower LM in 3 studies, lower MM in 3 studies and lower FFM in 4 studies. Three prospective studies measured the impact of enteral feeding and showed improvement on disease activity and LM or FFM, while one retrospective study did not show any impact on LM. CONCLUSION: Despite the variety of experimental approaches and methods used to assess sarcopenia, most studies showed reduction in MM, LM and FFM in IBD. Nutritional intervention may have a positive effect on LM and FFM. Future research should focus on standardizing the terminology and methodologies used in assessing body composition and investigating sarcopenia in diseased and matched healthy control cohorts in adequately powered studies with a longitudinal design."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disease categorized by low muscle strength, muscle quantity or quality, and physical performance. Sarcopenia etiology is multifaceted, and while resistance training is widely agreed upon for prevention and treatment, disease progression is also highly related to poor diet. The incidence of sarcopenia appears sex-specific and may be increased in females, which is problematic because dietary quality is often altered later in life, particularly after menopause. Identifying effective nutrition or supplementation interventions could be an important strategy to delay sarcopenia and related comorbidities in this vulnerable population. This systematic review examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of nutrition strategies on muscle-related components of sarcopenia in middle-aged and older females. A protocol was registered (PROSPERO CRD42022382943) and a systematic search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken. RCTs from 2013 to 2023 that assessed nutrition-only interventions on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in female participants were included. Fourteen RCTs were included based on selection criteria. Study designs and interventions were heterogeneous in supplementation type and amount, age, and duration. Six RCTs reported beneficial effects of protein, Vitamin D, Vitamin D and Magnesium (Mg), and fish oil on muscle protein synthesis, muscle strength, and/or muscle function. Eight studies that examined various protein interventions, VitD alone, Mg alone, and dairy derivatives did not demonstrate any effect. Exercise appeared to modulate results in several studies. Nutrition interventions alone are likely to have a limited but positive effect on muscle-related components of sarcopenia in females. Current evidence suggests that a combination of dietary intervention and exercise is likely to be key to preventing and treating sarcopenia in middle aged and older females and there is a need for well-designed nutrition based studies in this population."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence of increased muscle atrophy in IBD patients, likely resulting in a higher sarcopenia prevalence in IBD. The aims of this systematic review are A1; to estimate sarcopenia prevalence in IBD patients, A2; to investigate its impact on IBD patients, and A3; the effectiveness of nutritional interventions on muscle mass and/or strength in IBD patients. METHODS: On 28 July 2021, three electronic databases were used to identify eligible studies, including peer-reviewed studies (randomised controlled trials [RCTs], non-RCTs, observation studies) in adult (⩾ 18 years) IBD patients. For A1 and A2 only, studies defined low muscle mass and/or strength cut-off points. For A2, studies assessed association between sarcopenia and IBD complication. For A3, studies assessed the nutrition effect among IBD patients. RESULTS: 35 studies were included, 34 for A1, 20 for A2, and three for A3. 42% of adult IBD patients have myopenia, 34% have pre-sarcopenia, and 17% sarcopenia. Myopenic IBD was significantly associated with therapy failure including IBD-related surgery risk in six studies, risk of medical therapy failure in four studies, risk of hospitalisation in one study. A significant association existed with postoperative complications risk in IBD patients in four studies, reduction in BMD in two studies, and increased incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in one study. Sarcopenia in IBD was significantly associated with a reduction in BMD in one study. Two studies found a personalised nutrition plan (high protein) in IBD patients significantly improved muscle mass. One study found a significant positive association between muscle mass and dietary intake including high protein intake. CONCLUSION: Over one third of adult IBD patients have myopenia and pre-sarcopenia, and nearly a fifth have sarcopenia. Myopeninc IBD is significantly associated with increased risk of IBD therapy failure, postoperative complications, and low BMD, with possible association with increased NAFLD risk. Nutritional therapy may play a role in reversing low muscle mass though yet unclear if this is through disease activity reversal. Further studies on adult IBD patients focusing on sarcopenia/myopenia are needed with recommended study designs of 1) standardised population-based definitions with recommended standard methods used to measure skeletal muscle mass, 2) prospective studies with IBD patients stratified by Montreal classification, disease activity, disease duration and concomitant medication to observe muscle changes, 3) mechanistic studies on sarcopenia aetiology, specifically focusing on protein handling atrophy and absorption, 4) properly designed RCT to assess nutrition intervention in sarcopenic IBD patients."

            "abstract": "Aging involves numerous changes in body composition that include a decrease in skeletal muscle mass. The gradual reduction in muscle mass is associated with a simultaneous decrease in muscle strength, which leads to reduced mobility, fragility and loss of independence. This process called sarcopenia is secondary to several factors such as sedentary lifestyle, inadequate nutrition, chronic inflammatory state and neurological alterations. However, the endocrine changes associated with aging seem to be of special importance in the development of sarcopenia. On one hand, advancing age is associated with a decreased secretion of the main hormones that stimulate skeletal muscle mass and function (growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFI), testosterone and estradiol). On the other hand, the alteration of the IGF-I signaling along with decreased insulin sensitivity also have an important impact on myogenesis. Other hormones that decline with aging such as the adrenal-derived dehydroepiandrosterone, thyroid hormones and vitamin D seem to also be involved in sarcopenia. Adipokines released by adipose tissue show important changes during aging and can affect muscle physiology and metabolism. In addition, catabolic hormones such as cortisol and angiotensin II can accelerate aged-induced muscle atrophy, as they are involved in muscle wasting and their levels increase with age. The role played by all of these hormones and the possible use of some of them as therapeutic tools for treating sarcopenia will be discussed."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Muscle strength is a key predictor of both quality of life and mortality. Although numerous studies have investigated the relationship between omega-3 (ω-3) intake and muscle strength, the evidence remains inconclusive. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this association is influenced by protein intake. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential associations between plasma ω-3 levels (as a biomarker of ω-3 intake) and muscle strength across different age ranges and levels of protein intake. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1708 individuals aged 20-80 years from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Plasma levels of total ω-3 fatty acids and their subtypes-alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-were measured using chromatography-mass spectrometry. Muscle strength was assessed using handgrip strength, with the combined grip strength of both hands being analyzed. Dietary intake was evaluated using two 24-h recalls, and usual intake was estimated using the National Cancer Institute method. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between plasma ω-3 fatty acids and muscle strength, stratified by age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years) and protein intake categories (<0.8 g/kg/day, ≥0.8-<1.2 g/kg/day, and ≥1.2 g/kg/day), while adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Total plasma ω-3, ALA, EPA, and DHA were not associated with muscle strength in the total sample, regardless of protein intake levels. This lack of association remained consistent across all age groups and protein intake strata. CONCLUSION: Plasma ω-3 fatty acids were not associated with muscle strength, regardless of age or protein intake. Overall, these findings suggest that plasma ω-3 fatty acids may not play a significant role in muscle strength."

Nutritional assessment and optimization are integral to adequate management of a liver transplant (LT) candidate. A detailed nutritional assessment should be done at baseline in all potential transplant candidates with periodic reassessments. Sarcopenia is defined as a reduction in muscle mass, function, and/or performance. Skeletal muscle index at 3rd lumbar vertebra determined by computed tomography is the most objective tool to assess muscle mass. Hand-grip strength and gait speed are simple tools to gauge muscle strength and performance, respectively. Sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and myosteatosis portend poor outcomes. Sarcopenia contributes greatly to frailty, which is a syndrome of reduced physiological reserve and impaired response to stressors. Dietary interventions must ensure adequate calorie (35-40 kcal/kg/day) and protein (1.2-1.5 gm/kg/day) intake via multiple frequent meals and late-evening calorie-dense snack. Micronutrient supplementation is essential, keeping in mind the etiology of cirrhosis. Individualized, gradually up-titrated exercise prescription consisting of both aerobic and resistance training of 150 min/week is advisable after appropriate risk assessment. Early initiation of enteral nutrition within 12-24 h of LT is recommended. Data with respect to immune-nutrition, monomeric formulas, and hormone replacement remain conflicting at present. A multidisciplinary team comprising of hepatologists, transplant surgeons, intensivists, dieticians, and physiotherapists is vital to improve overall nutrition and outcomes in this vulnerable group."

Thus, this article aims to review the association between dietary pattern or food groups consisting of natural food and sarcopenia. A literature search was performed using four databases namely PubMed, Scopus, Sage and ScienceDirect. The search terms used were 'fruits', 'vegetables', 'egg', 'fish', 'chicken', 'protein food', '<i>ulam</i>', 'fresh herbs', 'sarcopenia', 'elderly and 'older adults'. A total of 18 studies were included in the final review. Adherence to Mediterranean and Japanese dietary pattern were associated with lower prevalence of sarcopenia whereas Western dietary pattern was significantly associated with higher risk of sarcopenia. For food groups, there is a significant association between dietary protein intake and sarcopenia. There are also significant associations between the intake of vegetables, fruits or both vegetables and fruits, and lower risk of sarcopenia. Consumption of natural food comprising of high-quality protein, fruits and vegetables have been associated with protection against muscle wasting and sarcopenia. Therefore, it is possible that a well-planned diet may works just as effectively as or possibly better than individual nutrient supplements for the prevention and treatment for sarcopenia among older adults."

These conditions often lead to sarcopenia, which is the loss of skeletal muscle volume and increased muscle weakness. Recent studies have demonstrated that PEM and sarcopenia are predictors for poor survival in LC patients. Nutrition and exercise management can improve PEM and sarcopenia in those patients. Nutrition management includes sufficient dietary intake and improved nutrient metabolism. With the current high prevalence of obesity, the number of obese LC patients has increased, and restriction of excessive caloric intake without the exacerbation of impaired nutrient metabolism is required for such patients. Branched chain amino acids are good candidates for supplemental nutrients for both obese and non-obese LC patients. Exercise management can increase skeletal muscle volume and strength and improve insulin resistance; however, nutritional status and LC complications should be assessed before an exercise management regimen is implemented in LC patients. The establishment of optimal exercise regimens for LC patients is currently required. In this review, we describe nutritional status and its clinical impact on the outcomes of LC patients and discuss general nutrition and exercise management in LC patients."

The pathophysiological connection between sarcopenia and T2D is complex but likely involves glycemic control, inflammation, oxidative stress, and adiposity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Resistance exercise and aerobic training are two lifestyle interventions that may improve glycemic control in older adults with T2D and counteract sarcopenia. Further, there is evidence that dietary protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, creatine monohydrate, and Vitamin D hold potential to augment some of these benefits from exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this narrative review is: (1) discuss the pathophysiological link between age-related sarcopenia and T2D, and (2) discuss lifestyle interventions involving physical activity and nutrition that may counteract sarcopenia and T2D."

As such, sarcopenia poses a huge socioeconomic burden in developed countries. The development and implementation of effective interventions against sarcopenia are therefore a public health priority. A preliminary, fundamental step in such a process entails the agreement of researchers, healthcare professionals and policymakers around a unique operational definition of sarcopenia. This will facilitate the framing of a clear clinical entity to be incorporated in standard practice, the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, and the identification of biological targets for drug development."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive age-related musculoskeletal disorder characterized by loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, contributing to functional decline and increased risk of disability. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D (Vit D) plays a pivotal role in skeletal muscle physiology beyond its classical functions in bone metabolism. This review aims to critically analyze the relationship between serum Vit D levels and sarcopenia in older adults, focusing on pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, clinical evidence, and preventive strategies. An integrative narrative review of observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses published in the last decade was conducted. The analysis incorporated international diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia (EWGSOP2, AWGS, FNIH, IWGS), current guidelines for Vit D sufficiency, and molecular mechanisms related to Vit D receptor (VDR) signaling in muscle tissue. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are consistently associated with decreased muscle strength, reduced physical performance, and increased prevalence of sarcopenia. Although interventional trials using Vit D supplementation report variable results, benefits are more evident in individuals with baseline deficiency and when combined with protein intake and resistance training. Mechanistically, Vit D influences muscle health via genomic and non-genomic pathways, regulating calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling. Vit D deficiency represents a modifiable risk factor for sarcopenia and functional impairment in older adults. While current evidence supports its role in muscular health, future high-quality trials are needed to establish optimal serum thresholds and dosing strategies for prevention and treatment. An individualized, multimodal approach involving supplementation, exercise, and nutritional optimization appears most promising."

            "abstract": "Although the numbers of aged populations have risen considerably in the last few decades, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed an extensive vulnerability among these populations. Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adults-denoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost. In recovering patients, muscle strength and physical performance have been evaluated by electromyography and traditional tests such as the six-minute walk test. Effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are necessary in order to prevent muscle loss and associated physical decline in COVID-19 patients."

RECENT FINDINGS: Perioperative nutrition within multimodal prehabilitation programs improve postoperative outcomes. Perioperative fasting time can be reduced with beverages containing carbohydrate alone or blended with a nitrogenous source such as whey protein; this approach seems to be safe and improve outcome. The choice of protein-containing formula, as well as diet composition to be recommended early during the postoperative refeeding, can be optimized to reduce complications. Sarcopenia is an important risk factor for surgical patients, as such, prehabilitation along with preoperative nutrition is strongly advised. Perioperative supplementation with β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate to mitigate sarcopenia requires further investigation. Although perioperative nutritional interventions reduce healthcare costs, recent data suggest it has been scarcely prescribed. SUMMARY: Nutritional intervention is key in multimodal programs of enhanced recovery after surgery to ensure better outcomes. Perioperative fasting should be shortened, and include clear fluids containing carbohydrates and protein, especially in the early postoperative period. Multimodal prehabilitation is key to mitigate sarcopenia. Action to improve knowledge on the cost-effectiveness of nutritional interventions in the perioperative setting are needed."

However, there are insufficient epidemiological data on the intensity of PA needed to prevent age-related sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of PA intensity with skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength. METHODS: This was a population-based study with a cross-sectional design that was conducted using data from the 2008 - 2011 and 2014 - 2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which included a total of 11,162 participants aged ≥ 60 years. PA was assessed using the results of a questionnaire and organized by intensity, frequency, and duration. The study population was divided into the following groups based on PA intensity: no exercise, walking only, moderate PA, and vigorous PA. To assess sarcopenia, skeletal muscle index (SMI) and hand grip strength (HGS) were measured as indicators of muscle mass and strength, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between PA intensity and sarcopenia. RESULTS: SMI and HGS were significantly higher in men and women engaged in moderate to vigorous PA than in those who did not exercise. The odds ratios (ORs) for sarcopenia defined based on SMI and HGS were lowest in men engaged in vigorous PA (0.444, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.242 - 0.818 and 0.450, 95% CI: 0.228 - 0.890, respectively). In women, the OR for sarcopenia defined based on HGS was the lowest in the group engaged in vigorous PA (0.441, 95% CI: 0.199 - 0.975), while there was no risk reduction for sarcopenia defined based on SMI. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to vigorous PA was highly correlated with SMI and HGS in men and women. Intensive PA was positively correlated with sarcopenia prevention, which can be monitored using HGS."

Nutritional problems such as frailty, sarcopenia, undernutrition, protein-energy wasting (PEW), and cachexia may increase the risk of falls and fractures in patients with HD. This review aimed to summarize the impact of frailty, sarcopenia, undernutrition, PEW, and cachexia on falls in HD patients. The reported global incidence of falls in HD patients is 0.85-1.60 falls per patient per year. HD patients fall frequently, but few reports have investigated the relationship between nutrition-related problems and falls. Several studies reported that frailty and undernutrition increase the risk of falls in HD patients. Nutritional therapy may help to prevent falls in HD patients. HD patients' falls are caused by nutritional problems such as iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic factors. Falls increase a person's fear of falling, reducing physical activity, which then causes muscle weakness and further decreased physical activity; this cycle can cause multiple falls. Further research is necessary to clarify the relationships between falls and sarcopenia, cachexia, and PEW. Routine clinical assessments of nutrition-related problems are crucial to prevent falls in HD patients."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a commonly prevalent geriatric condition mainly characterized by progressive loss of the skeletal muscle mass that results in noticeably reduced muscle strength and quality. Most of the geriatric population above 60 years of age are overweight, leading to the accumulation of fat in the muscles resulting in abated muscle function. The increased loss of muscle mass is associated with high rates of disability, poor motility, frailty and mortality. The excessive degeneration of muscles is now also being observed in middle-aged people. Therefore, geriatrics has recently started shifting towards the identification of early stages of the disability in order to expand the life span of the patient and reduce physical dependence. Recent findings have indicated that patients with increased physical activity are also affected by sarcopenia, therefore indicating the role of nutritional supplements to enhance muscle health which in turn helps to counteract sarcopenia. Various interventions with physical training have not provided substantial improvements to this disorder, thereby highlighting the crucial role of nutritional supplementation in enhancing muscle mass and strength. Nutritional supplementation has not only been shown to enhance the positive effects of physical interventions but also have a profound impact on the gut microbiome that has come forward as a key regulator of muscle mass and function. This brief review throws light upon the efficiency of nutrients and nutraceutical supplementation by highlighting their ancillary effects in physical interventions as well as improving the gut microbiome status in sarcopenic adults, thereby giving rise to a multimodal intervention for the treatment of sarcopenia."

METHODS: A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted using publications retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and SCOPUS between January 1, 2005 and January 1, 2025, focusing on exercise and nutritional interventions for sarcopenia. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were employed to visualize research trends through analysis of annual publications, keyword evolution, journal contributions, author networks, country/regional distributions, institutional collaborations, citation patterns, and high-frequency terminology. RESULTS: The analysis included 886 publications demonstrating a consistent upward trajectory in annual output. Geographical shifts revealed a transition of research leadership from traditional centers in the United States and Europe to emerging Asian contributors, particularly China. High-frequency keywords analysis identified core concepts including \"Skeletal Muscle\" (Betweenness Centrality Degree, BCD 0.13), \"Resistance Exercise\" (BCD 0.11), and \"Muscle Strength\" (BCD 0.13), with nutritional components \"Dietary Protein\" (BCD 0.19), \"Vitamin D\" (BCD 0.14), and \"Amino Acids\" (BCD 0.18) forming distinct research clusters. Cluster analysis revealed five thematic domains: Protein Metabolism (Cluster 1), Body Composition Assessment (Cluster 2), Resistance Training Modalities (Cluster 3), Frailty Syndromes (Cluster 4), and Metabolic Regulation (Cluster 5). Temporal keyword evolution showed a paradigm shift from foundational terms (\"human skeletal muscle\", \"amino acids\") to clinical outcome measures (\"gait speed,\" \"physical function,\" \"inflammation\") and mechanisms. CONCLUSION: The research trend in sarcopenia is currently shifting from symptoms to underlying mechanisms. Meanwhile, the focus of exercise and nutritional interventions for sarcopenia is moving toward addressing the disease burden and health management of multiple chronic diseases associated with sarcopenia."

Sarcopenia first was regarded as an age-related disorder of older people (primary sarcopenia). Later it turned out that it can also occur in young age due to a range of chronic disorders such as cancer, anorexia or malnutrition (secondary sarcopenia). This paper overviews the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and the factors involved in the muscle mass loss, i.e., physical inactivity, insulin resistance, low-grade chronic inflammation, hepatokines and myokines. The basic feature is the imbalance between proteolysis and protein synthesis that leads to muscle atrophy. We discuss the relationship between liver, muscle and adipose tissue in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. To diagnose sarcopenia, there are a range of tests and tools that measure muscle strength and muscle mass as well as physical performance. The low muscle strength (hand grip strength) is the primary parameter of the diagnosis, the best measure of muscle function. The loss of skeletal muscle mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, bioelectric impedance analysis, computer tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging confirms diagnosis, while the decrease in physical performance reflects severe sarcopenia. For the treatment and prevention of progression, the most important is the regular physical activity started from early adulthood, and healthy diet containing protein-calorie hyperalimentation. In addition, a pharmacotherapy with the supplementation of vitamin D and testosterone, furthermore, the administration of L-carnitine and branched-chain amino acids can be recommended. In the case of secondary sarcopenia, the underlying disease also requires treatment. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(1): 3-12."

Protein nutrition has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in critically unwell patients; however, the impact on muscle function is less established. Therefore, the aim of this review was to systematically determine the effect of protein dose on skeletal muscle strength in critically ill patients. METHODS: we searched five databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, and PubMed) and clinical trial registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pregnant, adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), which assessed the impact of different doses of protein nutrition on muscle strength. Studies investigating only muscle structure or with co-interventions were excluded. Six RCTs were eligible for inclusion, and five were suitable for meta-analysis. RESULTS: there was a significant difference in skeletal muscle strength with higher versus lower protein intakes, with a mean difference of 2.36 kg (95% CI: 0.37-4.35). The mean difference in protein dose was 0.46 g/kg/d (95% CI: 0.29-0.64). Inconsistency was evident across the included studies, with risk of bias ranging from moderate to high. CONCLUSION: muscle strength of ICU patients does appear to be affected by different protein doses. However, trials focusing on muscle function are limited by number and quality, highlighting a clear need for future work."

In this sense, resistance training alongside proper protein intake are important strategies to mitigate the sarcopenia process in older individuals. However, adding protein supplementation (PS) to resistance training interventions for enhancing muscle strength and functional performance has shown mixed results in this population. Therefore, the present study aimed to review the most recent evidence regarding PS and its effects on muscle strength and functional parameters of older adults. In addition, the effect size of each individual study (post-pre intervention) was also calculated to provide further clinical relevance on the topic. The results of the studies included do not seem to support PS for healthy older adults with proper protein intake. However, further studies with other sample characteristics (very old, frail, obese, and inadequate protein consumption) must be carried out to better understand the effects of PS in an older population."

            "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly used in type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to their cardiorenal benefits and weight-lowering effects. However, concerns have emerged regarding their potential adverse impact on lean mass and muscle strength particularly in patients at risk for sarcopenia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of empagliflozin on skeletal muscle mass. Secondary objectives were to assess changes in glycemic control, body weight, fat mass and handgrip strength. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In this 24-week real-world observational study, 31 adult patients with T2D were assigned to either empagliflozin or non-SGLT2i treatment groups. Patients did not receive a high-protein diet, a resistance exercise program or any other weight-reducing medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies. Anthropometric measurements, body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and handgrip strength testing were performed at baseline and after 6 months. Sarcopenia was defined according to EWGSOP2 criteria. <i>Results</i>: The empagliflozin group showed significant improvements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass (<i>p</i> < 0.05 for all). No significant changes were observed in the empagliflozin group after 6 months in appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (from 7.81 ± 1.33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 7.84 ± 1.38 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.154). No statistically significant changes were observed in handgrip strength in either group. <i>Conclusions</i>: Empagliflozin treatment over six months led to favorable changes in metabolic parameters and fat mass without detrimental effects on skeletal muscle mass or muscle strength. In clinical practice, the selection of antidiabetic therapies should consider individual glycemic targets, cardiovascular and renal risks, weight management, comorbidities and sarcopenia risk. Resistance exercises and adequate dietary protein intake should be recommended to preserve muscle mass in at-risk patients. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm the long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on body composition particularly in older adults."

The underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia include anabolic resistance, which is defined as a poor muscle protein synthetic response to previously effective stimuli such as nutrients and exercise. Among the nutrients that humans ingest, amino acids directly trigger the synthesis of muscle proteins. The essential amino acid leucine, in particular, functions as a stimulatory signal. Leucine-enriched essential amino acids help overcome anabolic resistance in elderly individuals to effectively stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Long-term intake of leucine-enriched essential amino acids has a synergistic effect with exercise to increase skeletal muscle mass, strength, and walking speed in elderly individuals, and can be an effective countermeasure to sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "Age-associated alterations in muscle protein quantity and quality that adversely affect muscle structure, composition, and function have been referred to as sarcopenia. Muscle protein is metabolically active, and the age-associated loss of muscle protein mass is related to a loss of physical function and an inability to perform activities of daily living (physical frailty). It is important to maintain adequate reserves of muscle protein and amino acids as we age. As in all cachectic conditions, sarcopenia can be explained by an imbalance between the rates of muscle protein synthesis and muscle proteolysis, in which net muscle protein balance is negative. This review summarizes evidence that supports the notion that: (a). advancing age and physical frailty are associated with a reduction in the fasting rate of mixed and myosin heavy chain protein synthesis, which contributes to muscle protein wasting in advancing age; (b). this impairment can be corrected because resistance exercise acutely and dramatically increases the rate of muscle protein synthesis in men and women aged 76 years and older; and (c). resistance exercise training maintains a modest increment in the rate of muscle protein synthesis and contributes to muscle hypertrophy and improved muscle strength in frail elderly men and women. The cellular mechanisms responsible for these adaptations, as well as the role of nutrition and hormone replacement in reversing sarcopenia, require further investigation."

Sarcopenia is directly related to age, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor nutrition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 12-week progressive intensity Resistance Training (RT) associated with nutritional advice on the frequency of sarcopenia in older adults. A total of 74 older adults (37 in the intervention group and 37 in the control group), with a mean age of 69.1 ± 6.85 years, were included in the study. The sarcopenia status of the participants was assessed at baseline and after a 12-week intervention. In the intervention group, resistance training combined with nutritional counseling reduced the prevalence of sarcopenia from 35.14% to 0% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in handgrip strength (from 27.70 ± 10.71 to 30.24 ± 10.38 kg), chair stand test performance (from 14.04 ± 3.46 to 11.67 ± 1.80 s), and time up and go test (from 7.49 ± 1.20 to 6.74 ± 0.95 s) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). On the other hand, the control group increased the incidence of sarcopenia (<i>p</i> < 0.001). After 12 weeks, progressive intensity RT associated with nutritional advice proved to be an effective treatment to reverse sarcopenia and help participants remain non-sarcopenic. In addition, the results of this study provide information about efficient and non-pharmacological sarcopenia treatment."

The prevalence of sarcopenia in older people is approximately 50% in the rehabilitation setting, and also approximately 15% of inpatients without sarcopenia upon admission developed sarcopenia during hospitalization. There is a concern that secondary sarcopenia may occur iatrogenically during hospitalization. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is defined as sarcopenia caused by the activities of medical staff including doctors, nurses, or other health care professionals in healthcare facilities. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is categorized into activity-related, nutrition-related and disease-related-iatrogenic sarcopenia. Especially in acute phase hospitals, concentrating on the treatment of diseases with less attention to nutrition and activity is more likely to cause iatrogenic sarcopenia. Sarcopenic dysphagia is also an important aspect in rehabilitation medicine and nutritional care. Sarcopenic dysphagia is characterized by swallowing difficulty because of a loss of mass and function in whole-body skeletal and swallowing muscles. Sarcopenic dysphagia can be diagnosed using a 5-step algorithm for the condition. Iatrogenic sarcopenia and sarcopenic dysphagia are affected by nutrition, activity and diseases in a complex manner. Therefore, treatment of iatrogenic sarcopenia and sarcopenic dysphagia requires comprehensive interventions through nutrition management and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation nutrition is effective for preventing and treating iatrogenic sarcopenia and sarcopenic dysphagia. Rehabilitation nutrition can be practiced more effectively and comprehensively by using the rehabilitation nutrition care process, which is a systematic problem-solving method. Further research is required to verify the efficacy of rehabilitation nutrition for preventing or improving iatrogenic sarcopenia and/or sarcopenic dysphagia."

One noteworthy pair that warrants further evaluation is diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia, given that the latter occurs in 28 % of the population aged over 50 who have diabetes mellitus. The management of both entails nutritional interventions, making the development of unified dietary recommendations an alluring strategy. This review aims to elucidate the current recommendations for the combined management of sarcopenia and diabetes, while featuring elements that require further research. The goal of nutritional management is to improve muscle mass and strength while regulating metabolic risk and glucose levels. To ensure muscle synthesis in the elderly, recommendations align at daily calorie intake that exceeds 30 kcal/kg, with adjustments based on comorbidities. Additionally, a protein intake of at least 1-1.2 g/kg/d is essential, emphasizing both daily and per-meal intake, and can be achieved through diet or branched-amino-acids supplements. Specific considerations for diabetes include restricted protein intake in diabetic nephropathy and exploring the potential link between branched amino acids and insulin resistance. Further recommendations that both promote metabolic health and have demonstrated at least a potential to increase muscle strength include prioritizing polyunsaturated fatty acids as a fat source and maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D. Clinicians should consult their patients on dietary optimization, but evidence is insufficient to recommend additional supplementation. Lastly, an emerging challenge of diabetes and sarcopenia is sarcopenic obesity, which requires the combination of a hypocaloric diet with increased protein intake."

This results in sarcopenia (aging-related progressive losses of skeletal muscle mass and strength) that affects 10-16% of adults aged ≥ 60 years worldwide. Concentrations of some amino acids (AAs) such as branched-chain AAs, arginine, glutamine, glycine, and serine are reduced in the plasma of older than young adults likely due to insufficient protein intake, reduced protein digestibility, and increased AA catabolism by the portal-drained viscera. Acute, short-term, or long-term administration of some of these AAs or a mixture of proteinogenic AAs can enhance blood flow to skeletal muscle, activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin cell signaling pathway for the initiation of muscle protein synthesis, and modulate the metabolic activity of the muscle. In addition, some AA metabolites such as taurine, β-alanine, carnosine, and creatine have similar physiological effects on improving muscle mass and function in older adults. Long-term adequate intakes of protein and the AA metabolites can aid in mitigating sarcopenia in elderly adults. Appropriate combinations of animal- and plant-sourced foods are most desirable to maintain proper dietary AA balance."

Due to lack of physical exercise and oxidative stress, aging leads to sarcopenia and finally end up with frailty. Sarcopenia is a component of the frailty and described as age related degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle mass, strength and quality. Though the loss of muscle strength and mass gradually seem inevitable during aging, it can be partially prevented or overcome by a deeper insight into the pathogenesis. Sirtuin protein leads to longevity across different organisms ranging from worms to mammals. Expression of sirtuin protein increases during physical exercise and thus strengthens muscle mass. Satellite cells leads to muscle repair in a SIRT1 dependent manner. In addition, SIRT1 improves insulin sensitivity and induces autophagy in the aged mice. The current paper discussed the putative role of sirtuins in sarcopenia and frailty. Moreover, it highlighted the pathways by which sirtuins can inhibit ROS production, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions and therefore confers a protective role against frailty and sarcopenia. The critical role of sirtuins in the sarcopenia and frailty pathogenesis can eventually fuel the development of novel interventions by targeting sirtuins."

Adequate dietary protein to replace obligatory nitrogen loss and to support protein turnover is essential for maintaining muscle mass. It is usually suggested that protein requirements in older subjects are above 1 g/kg/d. PHYSICAL EXERCISE: Sedentary lifestyle may contribute to loss of skeletal mass in elderly people.

Aging is characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength - a phenomenon called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia has a complex multifactorial pathogenesis, which involves not only age-related changes in neuromuscular function, muscle protein turnover, and hormone levels and sensitivity, but also a chronic pro-inflammatory state, oxidative stress, and behavioral factors - in particular, nutritional status and degree of physical activity. According to the operational definition by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), the diagnosis of sarcopenia requires the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function, which can be defined by low muscle strength or low physical performance. Moreover, biomarkers of sarcopenia have been identified for its early detection and for a detailed identification of the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its development. Because sarcopenia is associated with important adverse health outcomes, such as frailty, hospitalization, and mortality, several therapeutic strategies have been identified that involve exercise training, nutritional supplementation, hormonal therapies, and novel strategies and are still under investigation. At the present time, only physical exercise has showed a positive effect in managing and preventing sarcopenia and its adverse health outcomes. Thus, further well-designed and well-conducted studies on sarcopenia are needed."

METHODS: According to the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and other foreign databases, as well as Chinese databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang, the literatures of randomized controlled trials with different intervention measures were searched. ADDIS software was used to compare and rank the results of the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2485 patients were included in the 30 randomized controlled trial items. According to the clinical manifestations of sarcopenia, 7 different forms of exercise and nutrition interventions can improve muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical function; in terms of improving muscle strength, resistance exercise has the most significant effect on improving grip strength (MD = 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.06-4.07]); resistance exercise combined with nutrition lifting performed best in chair standing test (MD = -2.37, 95% CI [-4.73 to -0.33]). For muscle mass gains, resistance training increased appendicular skeletal muscle mass significantly (MD = 0.90, 95% CI [0.11-1.73]), while resistance exercise combined with nutrition significantly increased fat-free mass (MD = 5.15, 95% CI [0.91-9.43]). For physical activity, resistance training improved walk speed best (MD = 0.28, 95% CI [0.15-0.41]), and resistance exercise combined with nutrition in the best results were seen in the timed up and go test (MD = -2.31, 95% CI [-4.26 to -0.38]). CONCLUSION: Compared with aerobic exercise, mixed exercise, nutrition, resistance combined with nutrition, mixed exercise combined with nutrition, and electric stimulation combined with nutrition, resistance exercise has more advantages in improving muscle mass, strength, and physical function performance. The clinical treatment of sarcopenia with resistance exercise intervention has a better curative effect."

Sarcopenia is intricately related to various health conditions, including obesity, dysphagia, and frailty, which underscores the complexity. Despite recent advances in metabolomics and other omics data for early detection and treatment, the precise characterization and diagnosis of sarcopenia remains challenging. In the present review we provide an overview of the complex metabolic mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia, with particular emphasis on protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and bone metabolism. The review highlights the importance of leucine and other amino acids in promoting muscle protein synthesis and clarifies the critical role played by amino acid metabolism in preserving muscular health. In addition, the review provides insights regarding lipid metabolism on sarcopenia, with an emphasis on the effects of inflammation and insulin resistance. The development of sarcopenia is largely influenced by insulin resistance, especially with regard to glucose metabolism. Overall, the review emphasizes the complex relationship between bone and muscle health by highlighting the interaction between sarcopenia and bone metabolism. Furthermore, the review outlines various therapeutic approaches and potential biomarkers for diagnosing sarcopenia. These include pharmacological strategies such as hormone replacement therapy and anabolic steroids as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise, nutrition, and dietary changes."

Significant ascites, a frequent finding in these patients, has an especially negative impact on oral nutrition. A negative caloric and protein balance can further deteriorate the already impaired synthetic function of the cirrhotic liver. An important factor in this situation is the diminished capacity of glycogen production and storage in the cirrhotic liver and, consequently, a reduced tolerability for fasting episodes. These episodes are frequently observed in hospitalized patients, e.g., while waiting for investigations, interventions or surgery. A comprehensive work-up of patients with advanced liver cirrhosis should include not only a thorough assessment regarding nutritional deficits, but also a muscularity analysis to identify patients with sarcopenia. The overall nutritional treatment goal is to cover caloric deficits and assure a sufficiently high protein intake. Furthermore, vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies should be identified and corrective measures implemented where required. Ideally, optimal nutrition management can not only prevent the progression of malnutrition and sarcopenia in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis, but positively influence the evolution of the liver disease."

The effect of poor nutrition status can exert long-lasting effects on children with end-stage organ disease requiring transplantation. Malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty are conditions that require provision of optimal nutrition to prevent or support the treatment of these conditions. Unfortunately, the literature on the assessment of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty in pediatric end-stage organ disease is scarce, thus leading to confusion on how to effectively identify them. Recently, the addition of a variety of validated nutrition and functional assessment techniques has assisted with appropriate assessment of these conditions. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the current literature for pediatric assessment of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty in the setting of solid organ transplantation and provide practicing nutrition clinicians a solid foundation for learning how to effectively assess these conditions with the current literature available."

Sarcopenia may be associated with general loss of body mass, or it may also occur along with obesity [sarcopenic obesity (SO)]. Although sarcopenia is associated with multiple comorbidities in older adults, its effects may even be more severe in patients with malignant disease where it has been shown to contribute to poor surgical outcomes, increased chemotherapy toxicity associated with both cytotoxic and targeted agents, as well as adversely impacting survival. While development of sarcopenia is a common age-related phenomenon, the associated catabolic processes appear to be promoted by physical inactivity, inadequate nutrition, and systemic low-grade inflammation, as well as intrinsic muscle and molecular changes, including mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired muscle stem cell regenerative capacity. Increased physical activity and adequate protein intake can reduce incidence and severity of sarcopenia in cancer patients, but many older cancer patients do not meet physical activity and nutrition recommendations, and cancer treatment can make it more difficult to make favorable lifestyle changes. Sarcopenia is discussed in terms of its adverse clinical consequences in older subjects and particularly, in older patients with cancer. Contributions of lifestyle, molecular, and cellular factors are likewise reviewed with suggestions for interventions to improve sarcopenia and its comorbid sequalae."

            "abstract": "The presence of sarcopenia is not only rapidly rising in geriatric clinical practice and research, but is also becoming a significant concept in numerous medical specialties. This rapidly rising concept has encouraged the need to identify methods for treating sarcopenia. Physical activity measures using resistance training exercise, combined with nutritional interventions (protein and amino acid supplementation) have shown to significantly improve muscle mass and strength in older persons. Moreover, resistance training may improve muscle strength and mass by improving protein synthesis in skeletal muscle cells. Aerobic exercise has also shown to hold beneficial impacts on sarcopenia by improving insulin sensitivity. At the moment, the literature indicates that most significant improvement in sarcopenia is based on exercise programs. Thus, this type of intervention should be implemented in a persistent manner over time in elders, with or at risk of muscle loss. At the same time, physical training exercise should include correcting nutritional deficits with supplementation methods. For example, in older sarcopenic patients with adequate renal function, daily protein intake should be increased to >1. 0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. In particular, leucine, - hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB), creatine and some milk-based proteins have been shown to improve skeletal muscle protein balance. In addition, it is also recommended for adjustment of for vitamin D deficiency, if present, considering the crucial role of vitamin D in the skeletal muscle. In this review, we provide evidence regarding the effects of different physical exercise protocols, specific nutritional intervention, and some new metabolic agents (HMB, citrulline malate, ornithine, and others) on clinical outcomes related to sarcopenia in older adults."

This condition results in physical disability, falls, fractures, poor quality of life, and increased health care costs. Evidence suggests that increased consumption of dietary protein and physical activity levels, especially resistance exercise, can counteract the trajectory of sarcopenia. Canadian guidelines for protein intake and physical activity were last updated in 2005 and 2011, respectively, and new evidence on sarcopenia diagnosis, prevention, and treatment is rapidly evolving. Protein recommendations are set as \"one-size-fits-all\" for both young and older adults. Recent evidence demonstrates that current recommendations are insufficient to meet the minimum protein requirement to counteract muscle loss and to stimulate hypertrophy in healthy older adults. Beyond quantity, protein quality is also essential to benefit muscle anabolism in older adults. In terms of physical activity, resistance exercise training is a potential strategy to counteract age-related effects, as it can elicit muscle hypertrophic response in addition to increases in muscle strength and function in older adults. Canadian physical activity guidelines lack details on how this modality of training should be performed. Current guidelines for protein intake and physical activity do not reflect recent knowledge on sarcopenia prevention. The gap between guidelines and the latest evidence on the maintenance and promotion of older adult's health highlight the need for updated protein and physical activity recommendations."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, or 'frailty of the elderly', is a condition of low muscle mass which is prevalent in older adults and post-menopausal women, leading to falls or worsening after falls. Age-related muscle thinning contributes to falls and fractures. Fractures lead to downward spiral toward the loss of independence in the elderly and ultimately, increased health care expenditures of approximately 4 billion pounds a year. The diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance. Sarcopenia is caused by imbalance between the anabolic and catabolic processes on the protein production pathway, as well as a decrease in satellite cells. Denervation, inflammation, hormonal changes, and mitochondrial decline further complicate the issue. Is it time that physicians begin to rethink the diagnosis of sarcopenia or frailty as a process that begins in mid-life? In women, it begins in menopause and ends with falls, fractures, or immobility due to weakness. Physicians often question which came first; frailty causing the fall or the fall worsening frailty, which leads to challenges in treatment. Sarcopenia treatment involves resistance training, appropriate diet and being proactive about the diagnosis. These low-risk lifestyle interventions should be recommended during mid-life well woman visits. Physicians can influence the outcomes of sarcopenia simply by providing an exercise prescription, supplement, and diet recommendation in early menopause. This article aims to change the thinking around sarcopenia from an 'end stage' diagnosis to a mid-life discussion around disease prevention and maintenance of health and muscle."

Finally, recent data show that the deterioration of the muscle condition occurs early prior to the development of advanced fibrosis (specifically in fatty liver disease). This underlines the interest of evaluating the muscle compartment during the pathogenesis of liver diseases, also before the emergence of cirrhosis."

Owing to its impact on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure, sarcopenia in the elderly has become a major focus of research and public policy debates worldwide. Despite its clinical importance, sarcopenia remains under-recognized and poorly managed in routine clinical practice, partly owing to the lack of available diagnostic testing and uniform diagnostic criteria. Since the World Health Organization and the United States assigned a disease code for sarcopenia in 2016, countries worldwide have assigned their own disease codes for sarcopenia. However, there are currently no approved pharmacological agents for the treatment of sarcopenia; therefore, interventions for sarcopenia primarily focus on physical therapy for muscle strengthening and gait training as well as adequate protein intake. In this review, we aimed to examine the latest information on the epidemiology, molecular mechanisms, interventions, and possible treatments with new drugs for sarcopenia."

Multiple organizations have published guidance documents on sarcopenia, offering evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and/or research. We aimed to appraise the methodological quality of the included documents and synthesize available recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and intervention of sarcopenia. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, guideline database, and guideline organizations and professional societies websites for clinical practices, consensus statements and position papers in terms of sarcopenia, muscle atrophy or muscle loss published before April 17, 2023. The AGREE II instrument was used by three independent reviewers to assess the methodological quality of these documents. RESULTS: Thirty-six guidance documents published between 2010 and 2023 were included. Seven documents fulfilled ≥ 50% of all the AGREE II domains. Seven underwent a Delphi process and six graded the strength of the recommendations. The process of screening (n=21), early diagnosis of sarcopenia (n=12), diagnosis of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia (n=10), and management (n=21) were increasingly recommended. SARC-F (n=14) was the most recommended screening tool, and the assessment of muscle function was considered the first step in diagnosing sarcopenia. The management strategy for both age-related and disease-related sarcopenia mainly focused on exercise and nutrition intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The guidance documents have provided referential recommendations that have great guiding significance. But the inconsistency in recommendations and variation in methodological rigour suggests that high-quality evidence is lacking yet."

Pathophysiology of sarcopenia is complex which makes its diagnosis difficult and there is no universal approach. It is a predictor of poor outcomes including post-operative complications, length of hospital stay and mortality in trauma and surgery patients. Sedentary lifestyle, age-dependent hormone and cytokine imbalance, decreased protein synthesis and regeneration, and motor unit remodelling are some of the main risk factors for sarcopenia. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, bio-electrical impedance analysis and computed tomography are frequently utilized for its diagnosis.

Going to evaluate the prevalence of the pathology, the scientific literature reports that are sarcopenic: 12-13 % of elderly living at home under 70 years of age, 24 % between 70 and 80, and up to 30-50 % of over 80; 35 % of elderly who access geriatric facilities, 15 % of subjects develop sarcopenia during hospitalization; 87 % of institutionalized elderly; 18 % of diabetic people; 20-70 % of cancer patients; 12-39 % of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 84 % of women and 100 % of men with grade II and III obesity. Given this background, Ministry of Health and the main Italian scientific societies of clinical nutrition, geriatrics and physiatry are signatories of the opinion paper entitled \"Inter-society Italian Manifesto for the prevention and therapy of sarcopenia\", which is presented in this paper. The manifesto's goal is to raise awareness on sarcopenia among the population, institutions and healthcare workers through various actions, in the form of a message, awareness poster and the establishment of the \"National Sarcopenia Day\" by the Ministry of Health. In this day, centers where sarcopenia is diagnosed and treated, such as geriatrics, rehabilitation, and clinical nutrition facilities, carry out free screening on the target population. As regards actions for healthcare workers, it is necessary to promote and support the training of general practitioners (GPs) and of staff working in healthcare and social healthcare facilities (such as nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, and motor science operators so that they can recognize and adequately treat sarcopenia."

METHODS: This study evaluated newly diagnosed outpatients with esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer prescribed ONS. Nutrition status was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and muscle strength was assessed using handgrip strength (HGS) dynamometry. ONS adherence was calculated as the ratio of self-reported intake to the prescribed amount and categorized as ≥80% or <80%. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were included. Most patients were ≥60 years of age (63%), were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (63%), were classified as stage III and IV (83%), and exhibited nutrition risk or malnutrition according to PG-SGA (89%). Patients with adherence ≥80% to ONS exhibited less weight loss and HGS reduction compared with patients with adherence <80% (P < 0.05). Although patients consuming a high-protein formula maintained HGS and those on a standard formula experienced a reduction, formula type did not predict HGS change in the multivariate analysis. ONS protein intake, adjusted for adherence, was a predictor of weight change (β: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02-0.2; P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Patients with adherence ≥80% to ONS experienced less reduction in both weight and HGS, whereas those consuming a high-protein formula maintained HGS. Notably, ONS protein intake, adjusted for adherence, was an independent predictor of weight change."

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Sedentary lifestyle and aging favor the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and their comorbidities. The loss of lean body mass reduces muscle strength, resulting in impaired functional capacity and leading to increased risks of chronic diseases with advancing age. Besides aging, conditions such as inappetence, social isolation, and inadequate dietary intake cause the loss of lean body mass and increased abdominal fatty mass, resulting in sarcopenic obesity and predisposition to type 2 diabetes. Compared to younger people, this condition is more common in the elderly owing to natural changes in body composition associated with aging. Lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity and improved dietary behaviors are effective for preventing the occurrence of comorbidities. Regarding muscle nutrition, besides caloric adequacy, meeting the requirements for the consumption of dietary amino acids and proteins is important for treating sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity because muscle tissue mainly consists of proteins and is, therefore, the largest reservoir of amino acids in the body. Thus, this review discusses the effects of dietary protein on the preservation of lean body mass, improvements in the functional capacity of muscle tissue, and prevention of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. In addition, we address the effects of regular physical training associated with dietary protein strategies on lean body mass, body fat loss, and muscle strength in the elderly at a risk for type 2 diabetes development. IMPACT STATEMENT: Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide health problem associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle, which predisposes affected individuals to mortality and morbidity. Additionally, aging and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors increase inflammation and insulin resistance, contributing to the reduction of cytokines related to muscle nutrition and the suppression of lipogenesis, resulting in the development of sarcopenic obesity. One strategy for the prevention of T2D is the avoidance of secondary aging by participating in healthy action programs, including exercise and nutritional interventions. This minireview of several studies demonstrates the impact of physical activity and nutritional interventions on gaining or preserving muscle mass and on the functional aspects of muscles with aging. It provides information on the effect of protein, leucine, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), and creatine supplementation on muscle mass, strength, and volume gain and on the prevention of the progressive decrease in muscle mass with aging in combination with maintaining regular physical activity."

The number of disabilities due to age is expected to double in 2060. Muscle mass is one of the most important factors of health and nutrition in old age and it constant loss is characteristic for process of ageing. Muscle mass is controlled by number of different factors. The most important of which is balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ageing has no influence on muscle protein degradation so for maintaining muscle mass it is better to target muscle protein synthesis. Optimal protein dose in the meal is the minimal amount of protein effecting in maximal anabolic response. Threshold for anabolic response increase with age. This process, named anabolic resistance can be overwhelmed with high amount of protein in diet. Experts in the field of ageing and nutrition recommend 1,2-1,5 g/kg/d protein for the maintaining of muscle mass, 1,2-1,5 g/kg/d for older with additional risk factors, 2,0 g/kg/d for seriously ill and malnourished. Physical training has synergistic influence with diet protein. Physical training improves muscle performance, muscle strength and prevents muscle wasting. Physical training combined with increased amount of protein in diet results with increased muscle mass."

Sarcopenia was assessed in 4023 community-dwelling older adults from West China using the AWGS 2014 diagnostic criteria. Cognitive function and nutrition status were assessed using the 10-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) scale, respectively. Mediation model regression analysis demonstrated that nutrition status was negatively associated with sarcopenia (β = -0.521; 95% CI: -0.583 to -0.459). The indirect effects of cognitive decline on sarcopenia were significant after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity (β = 0.015; 95% CI: 0.012 to 0.017), but the direct effects of cognitive decline on sarcopenia were not statistically significant after adding nutrition status as a parameter in the mediation model analysis (β = -0.001; 95% CI: -0.008 to 0.005). Structural equation model (SEM) framework pathway analysis confirmed the association between nutrition status, cognitive decline, and sarcopenia. These findings demonstrate that the negative effects of cognitive decline on sarcopenia were mediated by nutrition status. We therefore postulate that maintaining a good nutrition status delays the negative effects of cognitive decline on sarcopenia in older adults."

METHODS: Forty-seven elderly patients with hip fractures were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. The main outcome measures included protein uptake, muscle mass, and grip strength for sarcopenia in elderly patients. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to AWGS. Wholebody densitometry was used to measure skeletal muscle mass, and muscle strength was evaluated using handgrip testing. RESULTS: Of 47 patients with hip fractures (12 men and 35 women), 37 (79%) patients exhibited insufficient protein intake (range, 0.01-0.588 g/kg/day), and 10 (21%) patients exhibited excessive protein intake (range, 1.215-2.121 g/kg/day). The mean daily protein intake was 56.5 g (range, 7.2-136.0 g). Prevalence of low muscle strength (handgrip strength <18 kg in women and <26 kg in men) was detected in 13 (37%) women and 8 (67%) men (P=0.076). Sarcopenia (lower muscle mass and lower muscle strength) was detected in 9 (26%) women and 6 (50%) men (P=0.119). Although lower protein intake was marginally associated with sarcopenia (P=0.189), it was significantly associated with lower grip strength (P=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that insufficient protein intake in elderly patients with hip fractures was common, and lower protein intake was significantly associated with lower muscle strength."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy (concomitant prescription of ≥ 5 medications) affects a third of older people, and evidence suggests an association with sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass/quality, muscle strength, and/or physical performance). As such, deprescribing has been recommended in routine management of sarcopenia, however it's unknown whether deprescribing is beneficial. This systematic review aimed to understand effects of deprescribing on sarcopenia parameters in older adults. METHODS: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2023. All studies reporting effects of deprescribing interventions on sarcopenia parameters (primary outcomes) or nutritional intake (secondary outcomes) among older adults were included. Findings were summarised narratively, and study quality was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 4860 articles were identified and six were included (mean age range 67-87 years). Studies were heterogeneous in design, settings, follow-up periods, and outcomes. Deprescribing had no effect on skeletal muscle mass (n = 2). Positive effects were shown on handgrip strength with two studies reporting improvements following antihypertensive or benzodiazepines discontinuation and one showing no change between admission and discharge with general deprescribing. Outcomes of deprescribing on physical function outcomes varied based on the measures used. For example, one study showed no changes in timed up and go, Whereas effects on gait speed was contradictory in two studies, with preservation and deterioration reported. Two studies reported improvement between baseline and follow up in balance scores measured part of the Short physical performance battery or using the Short Berg's Balance Scale among those who discontinued antihypertensive and/or benzodiazepines. Two studies reported improvements in nutritional outcomes following deprescribing at hospital discharge, whereas two other studies reported no change or increase in weight loss. CONCLUSION: There is limited research about the impact of deprescribing on sarcopenia parameters. This systematic review found no significant changes in muscle mass but there is some evidence in improvements in strength, physical performance, and nutritional status with deprescribing. The multidisciplinary implementation of nutrition and exercise therapies, as well as medication management to modify polypharmacy, may further promote improvement in sarcopenia. However, more high-quality research is needed to understand the effects of deprescribing on sarcopenia parameters among older people including those with confirmed diagnosis of sarcopenia. REGISTRATION: The review was registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42023417997)."

In this review, the authors outline the magnitude of these losses, their functional consequences, and the efficacy of strength training (ST) as an intervention strategy for delaying, preventing or reversing the effects of sarcopenia. The question of whether sex differences and genetics influence the effects of sarcopenia and responses to ST are also discussed. Although many potential mechanisms for sarcopenia exist, their specific contributions are still unknown. Nevertheless, proposed mechanisms of sarcopenia are outlined and, where information is available, we examine the effects of ST on these potential mechanisms, which include neurogenic factors, anabolic hormones, protein synthesis, gene expression, muscle morphology, and muscle regeneration. Finally, the potential impact of genetics in the muscle response to both sarcopenia and ST is discussed. The evidence presented suggests that ST is an effective intervention for improving strength, muscle mass and muscle quality and delaying the onset of physical disability in the elderly. However, sex differences and genetic factors may play an important role in determining the muscular response to aging and ST."

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and low muscle strength in Korean adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 14,354 participants aged ≥ 19 years in the 7th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII, 2016-2018). Low muscle strength was defined as handgrip strength < 28 kg for men and <18 kg for women, and serum hsCRP levels were categorized as normal (<1.0 mg/L), elevated (1.0-3.0 mg/L), and high (≥3.0 mg/L). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between serum hsCRP level and low muscle strength with adjustment for possible confounders. RESULTS: Among Korean adults, 27.7% had elevated or high hsCRP level, and low muscle strength was prevalent in older adults ≥ 65 years (men 22.7%, women 34.1%). Elevated hsCRP was associated with increased odds of low muscle strength in middle-aged women 40-64 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.09) and in older women ≥ 65 years (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74). High hsCRP was associated with higher risk in older men (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.06-2.75) and older women (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.14-2.42). CONCLUSIONS: Higher hsCRP levels were independently associated with low muscle strength in middle-aged women and older adults. Downregulating inflammation through nutritional strategies could help prevent muscle decline with aging."

METHODS: Using data extracted from the 2014-2019 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we analyzed 5136 older people aged 65-79 years. The present teeth were based on 20 teeth, which is the criteria for comfortable mastication. The association of the risk of low muscle strength according to the present teeth was assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis, and the association was confirmed by dividing into subgroups according to sex. RESULTS: The prevalence of low muscle strength was 17.87% among all participants. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between low muscle strength and present teeth; a significant association was found even in the model in which all covariates were adjusted (odds ratios (OR) = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.61). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between present teeth and low muscle strength even in the model in which both covariates were adjusted for sex (Men, OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.02-1.95; Women, OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.06-1.6). CONCLUSION: An association between present teeth and low muscle strength was confirmed in older people in Korea. These results indicate that the importance of oral hygiene management should be emphasized to prevent muscle strength loss in older people."

            "abstract": "Due to their differing etiologies and consequences, it has been proposed that the term \"sarcopenia\" should revert to its original definition of age-related muscle mass declines, with a separate term, \"dynapenia\", describing muscle strength and function declines. There is increasing interest in the interactions of sarcopenia and dynapenia with obesity. Despite an apparent protective effect of obesity on fracture, increased adiposity may compromise bone health, and the presence of sarcopenia and/or dynapenia (\"sarcopenic obesity\" and \"dynapenic obesity\") may exacerbate the risk of falls and fracture in obese older adults. Weight loss interventions are likely to be beneficial for older adults with sarcopenic and dynapenic obesity but may result in further reductions in muscle and bone health. The addition of exercise including progressive resistance training and nutritional strategies, including protein and vitamin D supplementation, may optimise body composition and muscle function outcomes thereby reducing falls and fracture risk in this population."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cachexia is defined as a syndrome of multifactorial etiology characterized by severe weight loss, loss of muscle and fat mass and increase in protein catabolism. Cachexia in cancer is a predominant and debilitating syndrome. Sarcopenia is a primary disease of older age characterized by loss of muscle mass due to the aging process. Sarcopenia can be defined as a combination of low muscle strength and muscle mass. Sarcopenia often occurs in the geriatric population. METHOD: This is a review article, search for articles in Pubmed database, JCR and Cochrane database was made with the following keywords: &#8220;sarcopenia&#8221;, &#8220;cachexia&#8221;, &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; and &#8220;exercise&#8221;. RESULT: The main therapy of rehabilitation is exercise. Exercise can reduce the inflammatory response induced by cachexia or sarcopenia. Exercise can support autophagy. Physical activity can slow down weight loss and improve skeletal muscle function. Adequate strength exercise and aerobic exercise are important benefits for patients. Strength and aerobic exercise increase muscle strength and function and represent an important treatment strategy for cachexia and sarcopenia. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation treatment is an important part of treatment for patients with cachexia and sarcopenia."

During COPD progression, a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications develop, with sarcopenia being one of the most common extrapulmonary complications. Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of coexisting COPD and sarcopenia include systemic inflammation, hypoxia, hypercapnia, oxidative stress, protein metabolic imbalance, and myocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. These factors, individually or in concert, affect muscle function, resulting in decreased muscle mass and strength. The occurrence of sarcopenia severely affects the quality of life of patients with COPD, resulting in increased readmission rates, longer hospital admission, and higher mortality. In recent years, studies have found that oral supplementation with protein, micronutrients, fat, or a combination of nutritional supplements can improve the muscle strength and physical performance of these patients; some studies have also elucidated the possible underlying mechanisms. This review aimed to elucidate the role of nutrition among patients with coexisting COPD and sarcopenia."

Chewing ability is essential to maintain balanced oral nutrient intake. The study was designed to define the possible relationship between chewing ability and nutrition-related problems (malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty) in a holistic perspective. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited adults aged ≥65 years. All patients were evaluated with comprehensive geriatric assessment. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criterion. Malnutrition was determined according to body mass index, calf circumference, and Mini Nutritional Assessment short form (MNA-SF). Frailty status was diagnosed with the Clinical Frailty Scale. Masseter and gastrocnemius muscle thicknesses (MTs) were measured via ultrasonography imaging. Oral examinations were carried out by a dentist, and chewing performance was examined with a color-changeable chewing gum. RESULTS: Overall, 135 older adults (76 females) were analyzed. Mean ± SD age was 75.7 ± 7.2 years; 37.0% of the patients were frail, 3.7% were malnourished, 12.6% were sarcopenic, and 20.0% had poor chewing function. In the poor chewing function group, age and frailty scores were increased and the MNA-SF scores, handgrip strength, skeletal muscle index, and masseter MT were reduced (all P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, regression analysis showed that low grip strength and low gastrocnemius MT were independently associated with poor chewing ability. CONCLUSIONS: Chewing ability was related to sarcopenia. Age and low grip strength in females and low cognitive scores and having low gastrocnemius MT in males were independent variables affecting chewing ability."

OBJECTIVE: To compile and document the nature and extent of existing studies exploring non-pharmacological interventions as a strategy to prevent or treat possible sarcopenia or sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. METHOD: Thirteen databases were searched up from January 2010 to March 2023 and filters were limited to English and Chinese language. Studies with older adults (≥60 y) in the community were included. The review was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR guidance and seven stages of methodology framework. A descriptive synthesis of trial characteristics and effectiveness was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 59 studies were included in the analysis. Most studies were RCTs. Few studies enrolled older adults with possible sarcopenia. The 70-79 age group has been studied more than any other age group. Six intervention types were identified, including exercise-only, nutrition-only, health education-only, traditional Chinese medicine-only, multicomponent intervention and control type. Majority of exercise-only interventions received resistance-based exercise. In nutrition-only category, overall food intervention or nutrients intervention was more than dietary pattern. Moreover, exercise plus nutrition was the main sub-type in multicomponent interventions. Health education-only and traditional Chinese medicine-only interventions were less frequently identified. Most studies had high and moderate compliance. CONCLUSION: There is evidence for the effectiveness of exercise and exercise plus nutrition interventions in improving muscle strength and physical performance, whereas the effectiveness of other intervention types or their combinations requires additional research.

            "abstract": "With increasing age, people lose muscle strength and muscle mass. Acute illnesses, surgical interventions or chronic illnesses can quickly lead to immobility and even more muscle loss. For the elderly, there is a risk of reduced functionality and everyday skills. This syndrome, referred to sarcopenia, is characterized by a progressive and generalized loss of muscle mass and strength with negative consequences such as functional impairment and frailty. In the case of serious illnesses or surgical interventions, this is particularly noticeable in prolonged convalescence. Sarcopenia is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality. It is important to diagnose sarcopenia with the help of specific anamnesis questions and clinical functional examinations and to initiate adequate interventions, if possible preoperatively, for example. In addition to treating the underlying disease, it is crucial to always pay attention to the combination of a balanced protein-rich diet and appropriate physical training. Use of only one of the components or even the drug therapy approach is not effective."

This study aimed to determine the association between adherence to Mediterranean-style diet (MD), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top (JFG-ST), and modified JFG-ST (mJFG-ST) and muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling Japanese elderly. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This prospective cohort study recruited individuals aged over 60 years from a community college in Nagoya, Japan. PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: A total of 666 participants were followed up annually from 2014 to 2017. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements, and sarcopenia parameters including walking speed (WS), hand grip strength in the dominant hand (HGS), and skeletal mass index (SMI) were recorded. Self-recall dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire comprising 29 food groups. Adherence to MD, DASH, JFG-ST, and mJFG-ST was determined by tertiles. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of all participants (56.5% women) was 69.4±4.4 years. WS, HGS, and SMI were 1.4±0.2 (m/s), 28.9±8.1 (kg), and 6.7±1.0 (kg/m2), respectively. In longitudinal analysis, participants with higher JFG-ST adherence scores were more likely to have higher SMI (Q3 vs. Q1: mean difference, 0.048; p=0.04) after adjustment, and its benefits were more evident in men (Q2 vs. Q1: mean difference, 0.098; p=0.047; Q3 vs. Q1: mean difference, 0.091; p=0.017) than in women. WS and HGS were not associated with any type of dietary pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to JFG-ST was positively associated with SMI in Japanese community-dwelling elderly adults aged over 60 years, specifically in men. The country-specific dietary recommendations are required to be developed for sarcopenia prevention."

Although nutrition plays an important role in maintaining bone and muscle health, the complex relationship between number of teeth and nutrition in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia remains to be elucidated. METHODS: A large multi-ethnic sample of 4149 participants aged over 50 years old from West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study was analyzed. We examined the associations between number of teeth with nutritional status and sarcopenia, and the mediating role of nutrition in the association between number of teeth and sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019. We assessed nutrition using Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) scale. Direct relationships between number of teeth, nutrition and sarcopenia were assessed using multiple linear regression. Mediation models and structural equation model (SEM) pathway analysis were used to test the mediating role of nutrition in the relationship between number of teeth and sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 4149 participants aged 50 years old or older, the prevalence of sarcopenia was 22.5, 9.0% for moderate sarcopenia, and 13.5% for severe sarcopenia, respectively. Regression analysis indicated a total association between number of teeth (β = - 0.327, 95% CI - 0.471 to - 0.237, p < 0.001) and sarcopenia. After adjusted MNA-SF scores, the association between number of teeth and sarcopenia was still significant (β = - 0.269, 95% CI - 0.364 to - 0.175, p < 0.001), indicating a partial mediation effect of nutrition. Mediation analysis verified nutrition partially mediate the associations between number of teeth and sarcopenia (indirect effect estimate = - 0.0272, bootstrap 95% CI - 0.0324 to - 0.0222; direct effect estimate = - 0.0899, bootstrap 95% CI - 0.1049 to - 0.0738). And this mediation effect was through impacting SMI (indirect effect estimate = - 0.0283, bootstrap 95% CI - 0.0336 to - 0.0232) and grip strength (indirect effect estimate = - 0.0067, bootstrap 95% CI - 0.0094 to - 0.0043). Structural equation model (SEM) framework pathway analysis confirmed the association between number of teeth, nutrition, and sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that sarcopenia was associated with number of teeth and poorer nutritional status, with nutrition partially mediating the association between number of teeth and sarcopenia. Our findings supported early nutritional assessment and intervention in oral health to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia."

It has been demonstrated that pesticides/insecticides are linked to various health issues, including DM. This study investigated the relationships between exposure to pesticides/insecticides and muscle strength among community-dwelling DM patients in a national sample of the United States (US). METHODS: Data from the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on people aged 20 years with diabetes were retrieved. A digital dynamometer was used to quantify handgrip strength, and urine pesticide concentrations were determined through laboratory testing. Regression models were used to investigate the relationship between pesticide/insecticide exposure and handgrip strength. RESULTS: After weighting, the data from 412 NHANES participants represented 6,696,865 U.S. inhabitants. The mean age of the participants was 58.8 years. High para-nitrophenol levels (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) were shown to be associated with lower handgrip strength in both males (aBeta = -7.25, 95% CI: -11.25, -3.25) and females (aBeta = -3.73, 95% CI: -6.89, -0.56). Further, females with elevated 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-pyrimidinol had decreased handgrip strength. Desethyl hydroxy N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) was inversely related to handgrip strength in men aged ≥60 years. DEET acid and para-nitrophenol were inversely correlated to handgrip strength in women over 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study has linked certain pesticides/insecticides to decreased muscle strength in people with diabetes. Para-nitrophenol, in particular, is negatively related to muscular strength in both males and females, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-pyrimidinol is inversely related to muscle strength in females."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of nutrition disorders and nutrition-related conditions in the same patient group. METHODS: A total of 253 older patients with Alzheimer's disease underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment, which included nutrition-related disorders, malnutrition via the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), frailty via the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and sarcopenia was diagnosed according to European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People-2 criteria. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 79.8 ± 6.5 years, and 58.1% were women. In our patients, 64.8% had malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition; 38.3% had sarcopenia; 19.8% were prefrail; and 80.2% were frail. Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia prevalence increased as the Alzheimer's disease stage progressed. Malnutrition was found to be significantly related with frailty scores via CFS (odds ratio [OR], 1.397; P = 0.0049) and muscle mass via fat-free mass index (FFMI) (OR, 0.793; P = 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, age, MNA-SF, and CFS were included in the model to detect the independent correlates of probable and confirmed sarcopenia. CFS was independently associated with probable and confirmed sarcopenia (OR, 1.822; P = 0.013; OR, 2.671; P = 0.001, respectively). Frailty was similarly related with FFMI (OR, 0.836; P = 0.031). Obesity was independently related with FFMI (OR, 0.688; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, nutrition disorders and nutrition-related conditions can present concurrently in patients with all stages of Alzheimer's disease; therefore, these frequent problems should be screened and diagnosed accordingly."

            "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally and the second cancer in terms of mortality. The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with CRC ranges between 12%-60%. Sarcopenia comes from the Greek \"sarx\" for flesh, and \"penia\" for loss. Sarcopenia is considered a phenomenon of the aging process and precedes the onset of frailty (primary sarcopenia), but sarcopenia may also result from pathogenic mechanisms and that disorder is termed secondary sarcopenia. Sarcopenia diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of low muscle quantity or quality. Three parameters need to be measured: muscle strength, muscle quantity and physical performance. The standard method to evaluate muscle mass is by analyzing the tomographic total cross-sectional area of all muscle groups at the level of lumbar 3rd vertebra. Sarcopenia may negatively impact on the postoperative outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgical resection. It has been described an association between sarcopenia and numerous poor short-term CRC outcomes like increased perioperative mortality, postoperative sepsis, prolonged length of stay, increased cost of care and physical disability. Sarcopenia may also negatively impact on overall survival, disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and cancer-specific survival in patients with non-metastatic and metastatic colorectal cancer. Furthermore, patients with sarcopenia seem prone to toxic effects during chemotherapy, requiring dose deescalations or treatment delays, which seems to reduce treatment efficacy. A multimodal approach including nutritional support (dietary intake, high energy, high protein, and omega-3 fatty acids), exercise programs and anabolic-orexigenic agents (ghrelin, anamorelin), could contribute to muscle mass preservation. Addition of sarcopenia screening to the established clinical-pathological scores for patients undergoing oncological treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) seems to be the next step for the best of care of CRC patients."

Flavonoids may contribute to treating sarcopenia, and attenuate the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function, however, their benefits in sarcopenic individuals remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of flavonoids on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in adults with sarcopenia based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This review was conducted in conformity with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The article search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science databases, and Google Scholar for the period until June 2023. RCTs that assessed the effects of flavonoids/flavonoids combined with other supplementation/flavonoid-rich supplementations on skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in adults diagnosed with sarcopenia before intervention were included. From the 309 articles found, a total of 6 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. RCTs evaluated the main outcomes of tea catechins, epicatechin, and isoflavones intervention. Skeletal muscle mass significantly increased in three studies, muscle strength significantly elevated in two studies, and physical performance significantly improved in two studies. The majority of studies (five in six) found at least one of the main outcomes is elevated by flavonoids intervention. Flavonoids may have a great potential to treat sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterized by a progressive generalized decrease of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function with aging. Recently, the genetic determination has been associated with muscle mass and muscle strength in elderly. These two phenotypes of risk are the most commonly recognized and studied for sarcopenia, with heritability ranging from 30 to 85% for muscle strength and 45-90% for muscle mass. It is well known that the development and maintenance of muscle mass in early adulthood reduces the risk of developing sarcopenia and leads to a healthy aging. For that reason it seems important to identify which genetic factors interact with aging and in particular with the musculoskeletal response to exercise in such individuals. This review is designed to summarize the most important and representative studies about the possible association between certain genetic polymorphisms and muscle phenotypes in older populations. Also we will focuses on nutrition and some concerns associated with aging, including the role that exercise can have on reducing the negative effects of this phenomenon. Some results are inconsistent between studies and more replication studies underlying sarcopenia are needed, with larger samples and with different life cycles, particularly in the type and level of physical activity throughout life. In future we believe that further progress in understanding the genetic etiology and the metabolic pathways will provide valuable information on important biological mechanisms underlying the muscle physiology. This will enable better recognition of individuals at higher risk and the ability to more adequately address this debilitating condition."

A total of 358 patients who were newly diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at our institution between November 2021 and August 2022 were enrolled. Eighty-four patients met the eligibility criteria. The mean TMT was measured within initial brain MRI using previously described methods. Pearson's correlation analyses assessed the relationship between grip strength and TMT. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify associations between TMT and other associated factors including grip strength, sarcopenia risk, body mass index, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and Geriatric nutrition risk index. Mean TMT values indicated a strong correlation with the grip strength of the non-hemiplegic hand in both male and female patients. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that TMT was associated with grip strength and sarcopenia risk in hemiplegic patients. Measuring TMT using cranial MR images during the initial stages of stroke could help predict a patient's pre-stroke muscle strength status. Further studies are required to apply TMT in pre-stroke sarcopenia diagnosis."

Epidemiological studies suggest strong associations between protein intake and the different elements of sarcopenia, namely maintenance of lean mass and muscle strength. Most often, protein intakes among older patients are below requirements, independently from situations of under nutrition. This opens the path for nutritional interventions to prevent the consequences of sarcopenia in older patients. Isolated amino-acids such as leucine have shown positive effects in the short term only. The positive effects of protein supplementations on muscle strength and function are currently not established in the absence of concomitant exercise training. The highest level of evidence supports interventions combining exercise and nutrition."

A previous study reported the frequency of sarcopenia in patients with chronic inflammation and found a higher rate of sarcopenia in patients with SLE than in control. A preview study found that exercises management given to SLE patients can reduce fatigue and increase vitality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand the relationship between sarcopenia and SLE from Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) standpoint and its intervention. METHODS: Using the PubMed computer-aided search engine specific keywords: \"sarcopenia\" AND \"Systemic lupus erythematosus\" OR \"lupus\" OR \"SLE\" OR \"physical medicine and rehabilitation\" OR \"rehabilitation\" OR \"physical therapy\" OR \"exercises\" OR \"physical activity\" OR \"training\" OR \"nutrition\" OR \"OR \"diet.\" RESULTS: Exercise rehabilitation can increase energy level, cardiovascular fitness, functional status, and physical capabilities of muscle strength and are safe to be performed by patients with SLE. Resistance training has been shown to improve muscle strength and size, increase mitochondrial content, and reduce oxidative stress. Resistance exercise impacts sarcopenia through several mechanisms in the muscular and neuromotor levels. Aerobic exercises are also beneficial for skeletal muscles to increase mitochondrial bioenergy, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce oxidative stresses. Nutritional interventions such as protein, amino acids, essential fatty acids, and vitamin D produce biological effects that will enhance the physiological adaptation of exercise. CONCLUSION: Intervention for maintaining muscle function in the prevention and management of sarcopenia in SLE and its complications is a combination of resistance training and nutritional intake through adequate protein intake."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Elderly residents (n=316) from three nursing homes included 112 men and 204 women. The appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI), grip strength, and movements were measured to diagnose sarcopenia. The correlation between sarcopenia with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ASMI, upper arm circumference, calf circumference, muscle content, grip strength, dietary intake, degree and duration of movement were also assessed. RESULTS The prevalence of sarcopenia was 28.8% (30.4% for men and 27.9% for women). Patients with sarcopenia were older compared with controls. Height, BMI, upper arm circumference, calf circumference and arm muscle mass, lower limb muscle mass, limb skeletal muscle index and ASMI, grip strength, and pace of movement were lower than controls. The prevalence of sarcopenia correlated with the intake of meat, fish, eggs, and milk, and duration of weekly aerobic and resistance exercise. Logistic regression analysis showed a positive correlation between the prevalence of sarcopenia and age, and a negative correlation between BMI and consumption of meat, eggs, and milk. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly residents in three nursing homes in Suzhou City was 28.8%. Increasing age was a risk factor for sarcopenia. Increased BMI and a diet containing meat, eggs, and milk were protective factors. The findings from this study provide support that adequate dietary protein can prevent sarcopenia in the elderly."

METHODS: This exploratory study was based on a cross-sectional study with 100 patients (≥65 years) admitted to two geriatric departments. Data was retrieved from the Electronic Patient Record. Malnutrition was defined according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria with no prior screening. A low-intake dehydration equation, using proxy urea, was applied. Obesity was diagnosed at BMI > 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Frailty was assessed by Clinical Frailty Scale, whereas sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the European Working Group of Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2). Sarcopenic obesity was defined as the combination of sarcopenia and obesity. Mortality was recorded up to one year after discharge. MAIN FINDINGS: The nutrition disorders and nutrition related conditions displayed considerable overlaps, and the prevalences were; frailty 67%, low-intake dehydration 62%, malnutrition 58%, sarcopenia 30%, obesity 13%, and sarcopenic obesity 0%. Higher numbers of nutrition disorders and nutrition related conditions combined, and malnutrition (according to GLIM) alone, were related to decreased one-year survival as show in Kaplan Meier plots. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and overlap of the nutrition disorders; malnutrition, and low-intake dehydration and the nutrition related conditions; frailty and sarcopenia were high in patients acutely admitted to geriatric departments. Increasing number of nutrition disorders and nutrition related conditions combined, and malnutrition alone were associated with decreased survival."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, generally defined by the loss of skeletal mass and function, may disproportionately affect elderly individuals and heavily influence spinal disease. Muscle atrophy is associated with myriad clinical problems, including thoracic kyphosis, increased sagittal vertical axis (SVA), spinal implant failures, and postoperative complications. As such, the aim of this narrative review is to synthesize pertinent literature detailing the intersection between sarcopenia and the impact of sarcopenia on the management of spine disease. Specifically, we focus on the domains of etiology, diagnosis and assessment, impact on the cervical and lumbar spine, spinal augmentation procedures, neoplastic disease, whiplash injury, and recovery/prevention. A narrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases from inception to July 12, 2024, for any cohort studies, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials. Case studies and conference abstracts were excluded. Diagnosis of sarcopenia relies on the assessment of muscle strength and quantity/quality. Strength may be assessed using clinical tools such as gait speed, timed up and go (TUG) test, or hand grip strength, whereas muscle quantity/quality may be assessed via computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA scan). Sarcopenia has a generally negative impact on the clinical course of those undergoing cervical and lumbar surgery, and may be predictive of mortality in those with neoplastic spinal disease. In addition, severe acceleration-deceleration (whiplash) injuries may result in cervical extensor muscle atrophy. Intervention and recovery measures include nutrition or exercise therapy, although the evidence for nutritional intervention is lacking. Sarcopenia is a widely prevalent pathology in the advanced-age population, in which the diagnostic criteria, impact on spinal pathology, and recovery/prevention measures remain understudied. However, further understanding of this therapeutically challenging pathology is paramount, as surgical outcome may be heavily influenced by sarcopenia status."

Exercise and nutrition represent common interventions to ameliorate sarcopenia in these patients, although there exists inconsistency in the reported effectiveness of these strategies. This study seeks to assess the impact of exercise and nutrition on sarcopenia in LC patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The research protocol was preregistered on PROSPERO, and adherence to PRISMA reporting guidelines was maintained throughout the systematic review process. Controlled vocabularies via Emtree, MeSH, and CINAHL Subject Heading were searched in five databases without any language limitation. The final analysis included only studies with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design published by December 2021. The quality of these studies was assessed by the Cochrane ROB 2.0 version, and the meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 version. RESULTS: A total of 262 studies were screened, and seven RCT studies involving 206 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. Exercise interventions encompassed muscle-strengthening, cardiopulmonary enhancement, and increased walking steps, while nutrition interventions included protein, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), carbohydrates, and vitamins. Most interventions had a duration of 8-12 weeks. Significant improvements in skeletal muscle index [mean difference (MD): 0.53, P=0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.10, 0.96, I<sup>2</sup>=0%] and albumin (MD: 0.16, P=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.31, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) were observed in the experimental group when interventions extended for 12 months. Various indicators, such as thigh circumference, midarm circumference, and sit-to-stand, showed significant improvements within the experimental groups following interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise and nutrition interventions demonstrate efficacy in improving sarcopenia in LC patients, with more pronounced effects observed with interventions lasting 12 months or longer. Skeletal muscle index and albumin levels in patients with LC can be positively influenced by exercise and nutrition strategies. Emphasizing a healthy diet and regular exercise is crucial for preventing sarcopenia in patients with LC."

The purpose of this review is to summarize recent evidence for exercise and nutrition in the management of hip fracture. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent randomized controlled trials of exercise have primarily consisted of isolated resistance training or multimodal home-based programs. More robust, long-term, or supervised training is generally associated with greater clinical benefits, including muscle strength, mobility, and function. Recent nutritional interventions have included multinutrient supplements, nutritional counseling and support, and vitamin D/calcium supplementation. Isolated nutritional interventions have not consistently shown significant impact on long-term outcomes after hip fracture, although improvements in body weight, biochemical indices, complication rates, and mobility have been reported. Overall, there is marked heterogeneity in the robustness of responses seen to hip fracture treatment studies. Few large, long-term, multicomponent interventions with clinically relevant outcomes of functional independence, need for residential care, mortality, and quality of life have been reported. SUMMARY: Evidence-based approaches to hip fracture should include comprehensive risk-factor assessment and treatment for sarcopenia/dynapenia, balance impairment, undernutrition of protein, energy, vitamin D and calcium, depression, cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, social isolation, and comorbid illness with exercise, nutrition and other modalities."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to examine to (1) the relation between OA and sarcopenia and to identify the most practical, easily accessible, and inexpensive method for investigating sarcopenia; (2) evaluation of sarcopenia risk factors in patients with OA. DESIGN: One hundred two patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis and 33 healthy control subjects were included in the study and all subjects were evaluated for sarcopenia. Dual-X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to measure body composition parameters and muscle thickness measurements with ultrasonography for diagnosis of sarcopenia. RESULTS: The mean age of the group with sarcopenia was statistically higher than the other two groups (p < 0.001). The weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, upper-mid-arm circumference, thigh, and leg circumference of osteoarthritis (OA) patients with sarcopenia were statistically lower than those of non-sarcopenic and control group (p < 0.01, p < 0.001). Body composition parameter results showed that sarcopenic patients had statistically lower values as fat mass, lean body mass, and skeletal muscle index (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) than those of non-sarcopenic and control group and fat mass index values (p = 0.012) are lower than the non-sarcopenic group. With respect to sarcopenia, the effect of adiponectin and leptin levels were not detected. It was determined that body composition values measured with DEXA, ultrasonographic measures, isokinetic muscle strength assessment, handgrip strength, and gait speed had predictive values for sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with sarcopenic OA were older, weaker, undernourished, and restricted in their level of physical activity in the study. Among the methods of determining sarcopenia, ultrasound becomes prominent with its practical, cheap, and easily accessible features. We think that our results will increase the awareness of the presence of sarcopenia in OA patients."

Sarcopenia may be a risk factor for frailty; however, risk factors for sarcopenia with frailty, and associated incidence of falls and poor quality of life remain unclear. We investigated the clinical characteristics and relevant factors for sarcopenia with frailty in older community-dwelling Japanese. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 331 Japanese community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 years. We assessed falls history in the past year, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS), age, total energy intake per ideal body weight (TEI/kg IBW), total protein intake/kg IBW, vitamin D intake, and exercise habits. Sarcopenia was determined using low hand grip strength or slow gait speed and low skeletal muscle mass index. Frailty was determined if ≥3 components, such as unintended weight loss, exhaustion, low muscle strength, slow gait speed, and low physical activity were present. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia with frailty was 3.6%; such participants had a higher risk of recurrent falls and lower PCS and MCS scores than robust participants. Age, TEI/kg IBW, total protein intake/kg IBW, and vitamin D intake were significantly associated with risk of sarcopenia with frailty by multivariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that sarcopenia with frailty was had higher incidences of recurrent fall and poor HRQOL than robust older adults. Aging and poor energy, protein, and vitamin D intake, may be relevant factors for sarcopenia with frailty."

The use of nutritional supplementations for improving physical performance and muscle strength parameters in older people is unclear. We therefore aimed to summarize the effect of nutritional supplementations compared to placebo on physical performance (i.e. tests more investigating physical function, utilising aerobic capacity & muscle power) and muscle strength (i.e. tests depending on muscle power) outcomes in older people in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A literature search in major databases was undertaken until the 01st September 2018. Eligible studies were RCTs investigating the effect of nutritional supplementations vs. placebo in older people (people having an age >60 years). Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used through a random effect model. Over 4007 potentially eligible articles, 32 RCTs for a total of 4137 older participants (2097 treated and 2040 placebo) (mean age: 76.3 years; 65% females) were included. Compared to placebo, multi-nutrient supplementations significantly improved chair rise time (n = 3; SMD=-0.90; 95%CI: -1.46 to -0.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 87%). Multi-nutrients significantly improved handgrip strength when compared to placebo (n = 6; 780 participants; SMD = 0.41; 95%CI: 0.06 to 0.76; I<sup>2</sup> = 79%), as did nutritional supplementations including protein (n = 7; 535 participants; SMD = 0.24; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 16%).Nutritional supplementations also led to a significant improvement in chair rise time and in handgrip strength in participants affected by frailty/sarcopenia and in those affected by medical conditions. In conclusion, nutritional supplementation can improve a number of physical performance outcomes in older people, particularly when they include multi-nutrients and in people already affected by specific medical conditions, or by frailty/sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a progressive, systemic skeletal muscle disorder. Resistance exercise and physical activity have been proven effective in its treatment, but consensus on pharmacological interventions has not yet been reached in clinical practice. β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a nutritional supplement that has demonstrated favorable effects on muscle protein turnover, potentially contributing to beneficial impacts on sarcopenia. AIM: To assess the potential positive effects of HMB or HMB-containing supplements on individuals with sarcopenia, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the treatment of sarcopenia with HMB. Two assessors independently conducted screening, data extraction, and bias risk assessment. Outcome data were synthesized through a random-effects model in meta-analysis, using the mean difference (MD) as the effect measure. RESULTS: A meta-analysis was conducted on six studies. HMB or HMB-rich nutritional supplements showed a statistically significant difference in Hand Grip Strength (HGS) for sarcopenia patients [MD = 1.26, 95%CI (0.41, 2.21), <i>p</i> = 0.004], while there was no statistically significant difference in Gait Speed (GS) [MD = 0.04, 95%CI (-0.01, 0.08), <i>p</i> = 0.09], Fat Mass (FM) [MD = -0.18, 95%CI (-0.38, 0.01), <i>p</i> = 0.07], Fat-Free Mass (FFM) [MD = 0.09, 95%CI (-0.23, 0.42), <i>p</i> = 0.58], and Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) [MD = 0.01, 95%CI (-0.00, 0.01), <i>p</i> = 0.13]. CONCLUSION: HMB or HMB-rich nutritional supplements are beneficial for muscle strength in sarcopenia patients. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating significant effects on both muscle strength and physical performance in sarcopenia individuals. HMB may be considered as a treatment option for sarcopenia patients. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42024512119."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, is a major health concern primarily affecting older adults worldwide. With no pharmaceutical cure for sarcopenia, dietary protein, probiotic supplementation, and physical exercise have gained increasing attention as lifestyle-based interventions. Dietary protein has shown promising effects in preventing the loss of skeletal muscle and physical strength by favorably influencing muscle protein synthesis in sarcopenic individuals. Probiotic supplementation has been associated with muscle regeneration, increased muscle protein synthesis among adults with sarcopenia, and improved exercise performance based on preliminary and emerging evidence. Multimodal or hybrid exercise programs have been shown to improve muscle strength, mobility, and overall physical function in individuals with sarcopenia. This paper reviews how combining protein, probiotics, and multimodal exercise may offer complementary strategies for sarcopenia management. Evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies suggests that these interventions may support muscle health by activating shared intracellular pathways such as mTOR signaling, the suppression of FOXO3a, and the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis."

The age-related loss of muscle strength as well as muscle mass and muscle function (sarcopenia) are i) risk factors for falling, ii) associated with physical function and iii) markers of the frailty syndrome. Muscle function appears to play a bigger role than muscle mass. The operationalization of sarcopenia using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) algorithm is consistently associated with falling events. Structured physical exercise plays the key role in the prevention of falls and the management of functional decline caused by sarcopenia and frailty.

Therefore, this study examined the association between nut consumption and low muscle strength among Korean adults. This cross-sectional analysis was conducted using single 24-h recall and handgrip strength data from 3962 younger adults 19-39 years, 6921 middle-aged adults 40-64 years and 3961 older adults ≥65 years participated in the seventh cycle (2016-2018) of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Low muscle strength was defined as handgrip strength <28 kg for men and <18 kg for women. Sex-specific OR were obtained for younger, middle-aged and older adults using multivariable logistic regression analyses. About one in four Korean adults were consuming nuts (using a culinary definition) with peanut being the most frequently consumed type. After adjustment for age, BMI, total energy intake, household income, alcohol consumption, smoking, resistance exercise, medical history and dietary protein intake, nut consumption was associated with the lower risk of low muscle strength among older adults ≥65 years (men: OR 0·55, 95 % CI (0·38, 0·79); women: OR 0·69, 95 % CI (0·51, 0·93)); however, this association was not observed among younger adults 19-39 years or middle-aged adults 40-64 years. Our results suggest that consuming nuts might be beneficial in lowering the risk of low muscle strength among Korean older adults."

Recently, body composition has attracted considerable attention as a means to assess nutrition status in patients with cancer. The clinical role of skeletal muscle mass has also been increasingly recognized. In patients with GC, sarcopenia, which is the loss of skeletal muscle mass, was found to be significantly associated with increased post-surgical complications including hospital stay, healthcare costs, and poor survival. In addition, sarcopenic obesity, which combines the health risks of obesity and sarcopenia, is recognized as a strong risk factor for poor short- and long-term outcomes following gastrectomy. The mechanism linking sarcopenia to worse postoperative outcomes remains unclear; however, skeletal muscle has been found to act as an endocrine organ that produces substances affecting the immune system. In addition, sarcopenia was reported to be associated with toxicity and termination of chemotherapy. Patients with sarcopenia may be unable to react appropriately to the stress of gastrectomy and perioperative chemotherapy. To improve the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with GC and sarcopenia, adequate energy and protein intake are necessary during resistance training. In the present study, we performed a literature review and presented a method to evaluate body composition, the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and GC, and perioperative nutrition and exercise therapy for patients with sarcopenia."

The purpose of this study was to explore and compare associations of sarcopenia components with self-reported physical activity and nutrition in older adults participating in resistance training at Helsinki University Research [HUR] and conventional gyms for over a year, once a week, on average. METHODS: The study looked at differences between HUR (n = 3) and conventional (n = 1) gyms. Muscle strength (via handgrip strength and chair stands), appendicular lean mass (ALM; via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and physical performance (via gait speed over a 4-m distance, short physical performance battery, timed up and go and 400-m walk tests) were evaluated in 80 community-dwelling older adults (mean ± SD 76.5 ± 6.5 years). Pearson correlations explored associations for sarcopenia components with self-reported physical activity (via Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly [PASE]) and nutrition (via Australian Eating Survey). RESULTS: No differences in PASE and the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) were observed between HUR and conventional gyms, however HUR gym participants had a significantly higher self-reported protein intake (108 ± 39 g vs 88 ± 27 g; p = 0.029) and a trend to have higher energy intake (9698 ± 3006 kJ vs 8266 ± 2904 kJ; p = 0.055). In both gym groups, gait speed was positively associated with self-reported physical activity (r = 0.275; p = 0.039 and r = 0.423; p = 0.044 for HUR and conventional gyms, respectively). ALM was positively associated with protein (p = 0.047, r = 0.418) and energy (p = 0.038, r = 0.435) intake in the conventional gym group. Similar associations were observed for ALM/h<sup>2</sup> in the HUR group. None of the sarcopenia components were associated with ARFS in either gym group. CONCLUSION: Older adults attending HUR and conventional gyms had similar self-reported function and nutrition (but not protein intake). Inadequate physical activity was associated with low gait speed and inadequate nutrition and low protein ingestion associated with low lean mas, even in older adults participating in exercise programs. Optimal physical activity and nutrition are important for maintaining muscle mass and function in older adults."

This literature review summarizes the impact of protein intake and supplementation on the indicators of severe sarcopenia-muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function in community-dwelling older adults. We performed a literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and MedLine, and included studies that evaluated the effects of protein intake with or without exercise intervention and on sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Information regarding study participants, protein intervention, and sarcopenia-related outcomes were collected. Protein supplementation with or without exercise positively improves muscle mass, and aspects of muscle strength and physical function in sarcopenic and pre-frail older adults, while it elicited inconclusive effects in healthy populations. Greater dietary animal-based and soy-based protein diets can improve muscle mass in older adults. In conclusion, protein supplementation can improve muscle mass and reduce the risk of sarcopenia in sarcopenia and pre-frail older adults, while future studies should continue to investigate the effects of protein supplementation on indicators of sarcopenia in healthy older adults."

            "abstract": "Progressive age-related reductions in muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) can cause substantial morbidity. This narrative review summarizes evidence of nutritional interventions for maintaining muscle mass and strength from midlife through old age. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched to identify studies of dietary intake and nutritional interventions for sustaining muscle mass and strength. The benefits of progressive resistance training with and without dietary interventions are well documented. Protein and amino acid (particularly leucine) intake should be considered, and supplementation may be warranted for those not meeting recommended intakes. Vitamin D receptors are expressed in muscle tissue; meta-analyses have shown that vitamin D benefits muscle strength. Data suggest that milk and other dairy products containing different bioactive compounds (i.e. protein, leucine) can enhance muscle protein synthesis, particularly when combined with resistance exercise. Omega-3 s can improve muscle mass and strength by mediating cell signaling and inflammation-related oxidative damage; no studies were specifically conducted in sarcopenia. Low-dose antioxidants (e.g. vitamins C and E) can protect muscle tissue from oxidative damage, but relevant studies are limited. Magnesium is involved with muscle contraction processes, and data have shown benefits to muscle strength. Acidogenic diets increase muscle protein breakdown, which is exacerbated by aging. Alkalizing compounds (e.g. bicarbonates) can promote muscle strength. Small studies of probiotics and plant extracts have generated interest, but few large studies have been conducted. Based on available data, dietary and supplemental interventions may add to the benefits of exercise on muscle mass and strength; effects independent of exercise have not been consistently shown."

In people > 60 years, sarcopenia reaches 10% and tends to increase with age. Individual nutrients, such as protein, may have a protective role against sarcopenia, but recent evidence suggests that protein alone has been ineffective in increasing muscle strength. Dietary patterns, instead, with a high \"anti-inflammatory\" potential, such as the Mediterranean dietary pattern, have been considered as an emerging dietary remedy against sarcopenia. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence of the role of Mediterranean diet in sarcopenia prevention and/or improvement, including recent data, in healthy elders. We searched published studies about sarcopenia and the Mediterranean diet until December 2022 in Pubmed, Cochrane, Scopus search engine and grey literature. In total, ten articles were identified as relevant: four cross-sectional studies and six prospective. No clinical trial was identified. Only three studies assessed sarcopenia presence and four measured muscle mass, which is an essential criterion in sarcopenia diagnosis. Mediterranean diet adherence had, in general, a positive role in muscle mass and muscle function, while the results were less clear with regard to muscle strength. Additionally, there was no evidence of a positive effect of the Mediterranean diet on sarcopenia. There is a need for conduction of clinical trials in order to reach cause-effects conclusions regarding the importance of the Mediterranean diet in sarcopenia prevention and management in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean populations."

Additionally, it sought to provide researchers with future research directions in this field. METHODS: Relevant publications were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, covering the period from January 1995 to October 2023. The collected publications were analyzed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix, and Review Manager. RESULTS: Out of the 2528 retrieved publications, the United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of publication volume. The University of Texas System was identified as the most productive institution. Luc J C van Loon emerged as the most published author in this field. Analysis of keywords revealed recent hot topics and emerging areas of interest, such as \"gut microbiota\" and \"mechanisms\". Upon further evaluation, resistance training (RT) and protein supplementation were identified as the most commonly employed and effective methods. CONCLUSION: RT and protein supplementation are widely recognized as effective strategies. Future research should focus on investigating the molecular aspects of sarcopenia. Moreover, the potential therapeutic role of gut microbiota in sarcopenia requires further comprehensive investigation in human subjects to establish its correlation."

A total of 103 patients (51% women) with SpA, mean age 47.1 ± 13.7 years, were included and compared to 103 age- and sex-matched controls. Grip strength was measured by dynamometry. Body composition was assessed by whole-body densitometry. In SpA patients gait speed was measured by the 4-m-distance walk test and quality of life was evaluated with a specific health-related questionnaire for sarcopenia (SaRQoL®). Twenty-two SpA patients (21%) versus 7 controls (7%) had a low grip strength, i.e., probable sarcopenia (p < 0.01), 15 SpA (15%) patients and 7 controls (7%) had low Skeletal Muscle mass Index (SMI) (ns), respectively, and 5 and 2% of SpA patients and controls had low grip strength and low SMI, i.e., confirmed sarcopenia (ns). All the sarcopenic SpA patients had a low gait speed, i.e., severe sarcopenia. Finally, probable sarcopenic SpA patients had significantly higher C-Reactive Protein (CRP, p < 0.001) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI score, p < 0.01), lower gait speed (p < 0.001), and SarQoL® score (p < 0.001) than SpA patients with normal grip strength. According to EWGSOP2 definition, the prevalence of probable sarcopenia was significantly higher in SpA patients compared to controls. Probable sarcopenia was associated with higher inflammation and disease activity, impaired muscle performance, and quality of life. These results suggest that muscle strength may be a salient hallmark in SpA."

The devastating health effects of sarcopenia are multiple: an increased falls risk, a decreased physical ability and quality of life and an independent increase of all-cause mortality. Although the ultimate remedy for sarcopenia yet has to be found, some interventions have proven their merit and might be of practical use in clinical practice, especially for geriatricians, who deal most with sarcopenia. This review intends to summarize the current therapeutic interventions, their proposed mechanism of action as well as their clinical value. The results of our review highlight the importance of exercise (50% resistance training, 50% endurance training), nutrition (25-30 g proteins with essential amino acids every meal and long-chain ω-3 fatty acids) and limitation of alcohol and smoking. In addition, studies also suggest a place for vitamin D (aim serum levels >30 ng/L), testosterone (aim serum levels >300 ng/dL) and creatine (15-20 g/d for five days, thereafter 3-5 g/d). In conclusion, although more studies are needed to elucidate the exact effectiveness and safety of many sarcopenia interventions, the current evidence already provides clinically useful information, which might benefit the patient with (pre-)sarcopenia."

However, evidence is limited regarding its effectiveness in post-stroke patients, who are at high risk for malnutrition, sarcopenia, oral problems, and dysphagia. This study aims to investigate the association between the triad approach and improvement in activities of daily living (ADL), muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using post-stroke patients. Patients were divided into groups based on their exposure to the triad approach, defined as a combination of intensive chair-stand exercise (rehabilitation), personalized food prescriptions (nutrition support), and oral management by dental professionals. We investigated the association between the triad approach and outcomes using multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for covariates. Primary outcome was Functional Independence Measure motor score (FIM-motor) at discharge and its gain. Secondary outcomes were handgrip strength (HGS) and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) at discharge. RESULTS: The study included 1012 post-stroke patients (median age 75.6 years; 54.1% men). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the triad approach had the strongest association with higher FIM-motor at discharge (β = 0.262, p < 0.001) and FIM-motor gain (β = 0.272, p < 0.001) compared to the individual or combined interventions. The triad also showed the strongest associations with higher HGS (β = 0.090, p = 0.017) and SMI (β = 0.041, p = 0.028) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The triad approach of intensive rehabilitation, personalized nutrition support, and oral management by dental professionals is strongly associated with improved ADL, muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass in post-stroke rehabilitation patients. Implementing this multidisciplinary strategy may maximize functional and muscle health recovery."

Nutrition-related disease is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. However, few studies have examined the relationship between nutrition-related diseases and cardiovascular mortality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of nutrition-related diseases with cardiovascular mortality based on a large nationally representative community population. DESIGN: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006 with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2015. Finally, 12,469 participants were analyzed. Each participant was assigned to one of four groups: normal nutrition without sarcopenia, sarcopenia with normal nutrition, malnutrition without sarcopenia, and malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome. Survival curves and Cox regressions based on the NHANES recommended weights were used to assess the association between nutrition-related diseases and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Of the 12,469 patients included in the study and divided into four groups, malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome had the highest 5- and 10-year cardiovascular mortality rates. After adjustment for related factors, sarcopenia with normal nutrition (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-2.06; P < 0.001), malnutrition without sarcopenia (HR: 1.28, 95% CI:1.03-1.58; P = 0.024), and malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome (HR: 2.66, 95% CI:1.89 - 3.74; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome remained associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.17 - 10.84; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome was highly prevalent among community-dwelling adults in the United States and was a strong prognostic factor for cardiovascular mortality in the community setting. Randomized clinical trials are needed to demonstrate whether prevention or treatment of malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome in community populations can reduce global cardiovascular mortality."

Diet plays a crucial role in muscle ageing being an important element of a healthy lifestyle. However, unlike single nutrients, such as dietary protein, or dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, the relationship between individual whole foods and muscle health has not been systematically evaluated. We aimed to investigate which whole foods (meat, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables, and non-liquid dairy) may be beneficial (myoprotective) for ageing muscle and sarcopenia in adults aged ≥ 50 years. Nineteen observational and nine intervention studies were identified through systematic searches of the four electronic databases (last search: March 2020). The synthesis of findings showed strong and consistent evidence for a beneficial effect of lean red meat on muscle mass or lean tissue mass in both observational and intervention studies. Higher intake of fruit and vegetables was associated with better muscle function in observational studies, but the evidence from intervention studies was scarce. Non-liquid dairy foods were beneficial for muscle mass in both observational and intervention studies. There was moderate evidence for the role of these foods in muscle strength and sarcopenia, and limited or inconclusive evidence for the benefits of other whole foods (e.g., fish, eggs) for muscle health in older adults. Although current nutritional recommendations are often based on a single nutrient approach, further research about the role of protein-rich and other foods in muscle health will allow for the development of guidelines that are based on whole foods, also highlighting the potential importance of non-protein nutrients within these foods for myoprotection in older adults."

It aims to answer the research question: What are the evidence, challenges, and needs for research regarding a home-based exercise and nutrition intervention program to improve muscle outcomes in senior adults? This scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension for Scoping Review. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Applied filters were used to help condense the research articles. A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Most exercise interventions were either resistance or multi-component exercise programs. The nature of the nutrition intervention varied between different supplements, foods, education, or counseling. Muscle outcomes included muscle mass in nine studies, muscle function in all the studies, muscle strength in ten studies, and biochemical analyses in two studies. Two studies found improvements in muscle mass; two studies revealed improvements in all their muscle function tests; and three studies revealed improvements in muscle strength. Muscle biopsy in a study revealed enhanced muscle fibers, but both studies did not reveal any biomarker improvements. The scoping review findings revealed mixed results on the effectiveness of a home-based exercise and nutrition program. However, the current evidence does have many gaps to address before recommending this form of intervention for senior adults as an effective way to prevent and manage sarcopenia. Since this review identified multiple knowledge gaps, strengths, and limitations in this growing field, it can be a starting point to help build future study designs and interventions in this population."

A comprehensive search of online databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of PS + MSE in elderly patients with sarcopenia or frailty. The included RCTs were analyzed using meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment. We finally included 19 RCTs in this meta-analysis with a median (range/total) Physiotherapy Evidence Database score of 7/10 (5-9/10). The PS + MSE group exhibited significant improvements in the whole-body LM (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.66; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), appendicular LM (SMD = 0.35; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), leg strength (SMD = 0.65; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and walking capability (SMD = 0.33; <i>p</i> = 0.0006). Meta-regression analyses showed that changes in appendicular LM were significantly associated with the effect sizes of leg strength (β = 0.08; <i>p</i> = 0.003) and walking capability (β = 0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.04), respectively. Our findings suggest that LM gain after PS + MSE significantly contributes to the efficacy of the intervention in terms of muscle strength and physical mobility in elderly patients with a high risk of sarcopenia or frailty."

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of sarcopenia in CKD is reported to be 5-62.5%, with higher rates observed later in the disease. Sarcopenic obesity rates are reported to be 2-23%. Sarcopenia in CKD is associated with increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease and vascular calcification. Risk factors include kidney disease itself and the impacts of CKD on lifestyle (reduced physical activity, diet changes). In earlier stages of CKD, if the risks from sarcopenia outweigh the risk of reaching end-stage renal disease, ensuring adequate energy intake combined with modest protein liberalization and physical activity may be indicated. Protein intakes above 1.3 g/kg of body weight per day should be avoided. For dialysis patients, interventions that provide a combination of carbohydrate, protein and fat appear more effective than those that provide protein alone, though it may take as long as 48 weeks for detectable changes in muscle mass. SUMMARY: Sarcopenia is prevalent in CKD as kidney disease significantly impacts muscle mass and function. Nutrition interventions can improve components of sarcopenia, with an emphasis on adequate energy and protein."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The aim of this review is to discuss and evaluate diabetic sarcopenia (DS) and its relationship with nutrition by discussing the mechanisms of diabetic sarcopenia in detail and comprehensively reviewing the literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) affects approximately 25% of people aged 50 years and over and indicates a significant the cost of health for the elderly. Nutrition is an important part of these treatment approaches, and in this review, the literature was comprehensively reviewed, focusing on understanding the mechanisms of DS and discussing its relationship with nutrition. A comprehensive search was conducted on Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed from inception up to July 2024. The aim of nutritional treatment for DS is to improve muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance while improving diabetes-related metabolic risk and glucose levels. In this context, it is important to determine energy intake in individuals with DS according to calorie intake exceeding 30 kcal/kg. For these individuals, a protein intake of at least 1-1.2 g/kg/day is recommended, with an emphasis on the number and timing of meals and a nutritional pattern rich in branched chain amino acids (BCAA). In addition, it is important to adopt a diet rich in antioxidants and to choose diet patterns that contain sufficient levels of macro and micronutrients. The Mediterranean diet model can be a good diet option for individuals with DS. Comprehensive studies in this field are needed so that clinicians can make specific dietary recommendations for DS."

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogeneous lung condition characterized by persistent airflow obstruction, associated with cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal comorbidities. In 2022, approximately 480 million people were affected by this disease, making it the third leading cause of mortality worldwide. Projections indicate that by 2050, this number could rise to 600 million. Nutrition status is a fundamental component in managing COPD patients, as it is a critical prognostic factor for morbidity and mortality. Patients with COPD may display different body composition phenotypes, ranging from cachexia to obesity to sarcopenia. Assessing body composition is essential to determine muscle mass, the latter crucial for respiratory function, and also to identify potential health risks and complications. Likewise, involuntary weight loss and decreased fat-free mass are associated with increased mortality. COPD should be viewed as a syndrome, or as a multimorbidity coexisting with other conditions, requiring comprehensive clinical and nutrition assessment for effective management. Nutrition intervention, including oral supplements, is crucial to preserve muscle mass and weight. Supplementation with protein, ω-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, along with pulmonary rehabilitation, improves muscle strength and exercise tolerance. This narrative review examines nutrition phenotypes and highlights the importance of nutrition interventions in patients with COPD. A multimodal approach combining nutrition support, physical exercise, and pharmacological treatments is essential for managing COPD and its associated comorbidities."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalised disorder of skeletal muscle strength, function and mass, that is most commonly associated with the normal ageing process. It is increasingly recognised that sarcopenia can also develop as a consequence of malabsorptive and inflammatory conditions, such as those seen by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. It affects 1%-30% of the general population, but is seen in approximately 40% of patients with gastrointestinal conditions including inflammatory bowel disease and cirrhosis. Within this group of patients, it is associated with increased complications and mortality. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is multifactorial with several risk factors implicated in its development including undernutrition, physical inactivity and coexistent multimorbidity. The SARC-F questionnaire has been developed to screen for patients at risk of sarcopenia, however, this focuses on the functional consequences and will therefore not identify those patients who are early in the progression of sarcopenia. There are several different non-invasive techniques available to assess muscle quantity and quality including; grip strength, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, CT which can be used together to diagnose sarcopenia. Assessment and correction of malnutrition, particularly protein intake, in those at risk of sarcopenia is important in preventing the development and progression of sarcopenia. There are no specific drugs that are available for the treatment of sarcopenia, however, resistance exercise programmes combined with nutritional interventions show promise. It is important that this common condition is screened for and recognised, with any contributing factors addressed to reduce the risk of its progression."

Sarcopenia results from a higher rate of muscle protein degradation compared to protein synthesis and is an important marker of metabolic status related to nutrition and physical activity. The diagnosis of sarcopenia is accomplished by clinical assessment demonstrating decreased muscle function and radiographic confirmation of decreased muscle mass, via dual X-ray absorptiometry, bioelectric impedance or cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI. However, normative data for skeletal muscle mass are lacking, especially for children and young adults. Additionally, studies of skeletal muscle mass by cross-sectional imaging in children are scarce.

A number of mechanisms are involved in sarcopenia development in LC, many of which are secondary to liver dysfunction and/or iatrogenic involvement in treating LC. Sarcopenia severity in this population appears to be affected by patient gender, as well as the primary aetiology of LC (alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease etc.) with patient demographics shifting in recent years. Clinical detection of sarcopenia in this population may involve a combination of assessment tools, in addition to measuring muscle mass and strength separately. Muscle mass may be assessed using radiography, bioelectric impedance, ultrasound, or anthropometrics. Hand-grip strength, on the other hand, may be a useful tool for evaluating muscle strength. The role of malnutrition in sarcopenia is also a relevant factor, and screening tools such as MELD and SARC-F may be clinically useful tools for more complete diagnosis of sarcopenia in these patients. Myostatin and titin-N may represent potential diagnostic biomarkers. Lastly, physical activity and nutrition remain key elements of treatment. Further research is being conducted regarding the role of resistance vs aerobic exercise as well as the function of complementary nutrition. Continued study into the role of nutrition, physical activity and other complementary therapies will be important future endeavours in the treatment of sarcopenia in LC."

            "abstract": "With aging, loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle function increases, resulting in an increased risk of falls, fractures, long-term institutional care, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and even death. Sarcopenia, which is derived from the Greek words \"sarx\" or flesh+\"penia\" or loss, is defined as a condition characterized by low muscle mass and low muscle strength and performance. In 2019, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) published a consensus paper on the diagnosis and treatment of sarcopenia. The AWGS 2019 guideline, specifically, presented strategies for case-finding and assessment to help diagnose \"possible sarcopenia\" in primary care settings. For case finding, the AWGS 2019 guideline proposed an algorithm that recommends calf circumference measurement (cut-off <34 cm in men, <33 cm in women) or the SARC-F (strength, assistance with walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and falls) questionnaire (cut-off ≥4). If this case finding is confirmed, handgrip strength (cutoff <28 kg in men, <18 kg in women) or the 5-time chair stand test (≥12 seconds) should be performed to diagnose \"possible sarcopenia.\" If an individual is diagnosed as \"possible sarcopenia,\" AWGS 2019 recommends that the individual should start lifestyle interventions and related health education for primary healthcare users. Because no medication is available to treat sarcopenia, exercise and nutrition is essential for sarcopenia management. Many guidelines, recommend physical activity, with a focus on progressive resistance (strength) training, as a first-line therapy for the management of sarcopenia. It is essential to educate older adults with sarcopenia on the need to increase protein intake. Many guidelines recommended that older people should consume at least 1.2 g of proteins/kg/d. This minimum threshold can be increased in the presence of catabolic or muscle wasting. Previous studies reported that leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is essential for protein synthesis in muscle, and a stimulator for skeletal muscle synthesis. A guideline conditionally recommends that diet or nutritional supplements should be combined with exercise intervention for older adults with sarcopenia."

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effectiveness of exercise, nutritional, drug, and combinational interventions for treating sarcopenia in older people. METHOD: We systematically searched MEDLINE via PubMed, the Cochrane Library of Cochrane Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ichushi-Web for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from January 2000 to December 2016. We have assessed the type of intervention, the cohort used, the way sarcopenia was diagnosed, the outcomes, and the quality of evidence. We meta-analyzed the outcomes with the net difference between-group treatment from baseline to the end of the study. RESULTS: We screened a total of 2668 records and included seven RCTs that investigated the effects of exercise (4 RCTs), nutrition (5 RCTs), drug (1 RCT), and combination (4 RCTs) on muscle mass, strength, and function in older people with sarcopenia. Very low to low-quality evidence suggests that (1) exercise interventions may play a role in improving muscle mass, muscle strength, and walking speed in 3 months of intervention; (2) nutritional interventions may be effective in improving muscle strength in 3 months of intervention; (3) as drug intervention, selective androgen receptor modulator had no clear effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function; and (4) a combined intervention of exercise and nutrition may have positive effects in improving the walking speed in 3 months of intervention. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed some positive effects of exercise and nutritional interventions for treating sarcopenia in older people, although the quality of the evidence was low. Future high-quality RCTs should be implemented to strengthen the results."

Evidence primarily from cross-sectional studies suggests that the prevalence of sarcopenia in people with HF is 37% for men and 33% for women, which contributes to cardiac cachexia, frailty, lower quality of life, and increased mortality rate. We explored the impact of resistance and aerobic exercise, and nutrition on measures of sarcopenia and frailty, and quality of life following the assessment of 35 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The majority of clinical trials have focused on resistance, aerobic, and concurrent exercise to counteract the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength in people with HF, while promising effects have also been shown via utilization of vitamin D and iron supplementation by reducing tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), c-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Experimental studies combining the concomitant effect of exercise and nutrition on measures of sarcopenia and frailty in people with HF are scarce. There is a pressing need for further research and well-designed clinical trials incorporating the anabolic and anti-catabolic effects of concurrent exercise and nutrition strategies in people with HF."

The condition is characterized by the progressive and generalized loss of muscle mass and strength, affecting physical performance. It is part of aging but can be exacerbated by pathophysiological conditions like cancer and several factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, chronic diseases, falls and immobilization. Numerous cellular mechanisms have been implicated in its pathogenesis, including hormonal changes, mitochondrial dysfunctions, altered apoptotic and autophagic signaling, muscle fiber composition, and inflammatory pathways. To prevent sarcopenia, exercise is one of the most effective strategies as it has a strong influence on both anabolic and catabolic muscle pathways and helps improve skeletal muscle function. A well-rounded, multicomponent exercise program that targets muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and balance is recommended for optimal results. While nutrition is essential for muscle maintenance, relying solely on dietary interventions is unlikely to fully address sarcopenia. Therefore, a combination of adequate nutrition and regular exercise is recommended to promote muscle health and function. The purpose of this study is to review sarcopenia from an aging viewpoint and discuss the role of exercise and nutrition as prevention and management options."

This review will summarize the classical mechanisms of protein nutritional support for alleviating sarcopenia, such as modulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, oxidative response, and cell autophagy, as well as the potential new mechanisms, including altering miRNA profiles and gut microbiota.

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although numerous studies have investigated the impact of dietary factors on the prevention of decreased muscle mass and function, limited research has examined the relationship between dietary patterns and sarcopenia. This study aimed to assess the associations between dietary patterns, and sarcopenia, muscle strength, and mass in adults following a Mediterranean diet residing in southern Italian cities. METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data from an existing database, comprising 528 individuals aged 50 years or older who underwent health-screening tests at the Clinical Nutrition Unit of the \"R.Dulbecco\" University Hospital. Strength was assessed through handgrip strength, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake information was collected through a food frequency questionnaire linked to the MetaDieta 3.0.1 nutrient composition database. Principal Component Analysis, a statistical technique identifying underlying relationships among different nutrients, was employed to determine dietary patterns. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the odds ratio for sarcopenia or low handgrip strength in relation to the lowest tertile of dietary pattern adherence compared to the highest adherence. RESULTS: The participants had a mean age of 61 ± 8 years. Four dietary patterns were identified, with only the Western and Mediterranean patterns showing correlations with handgrip strength and appendicular skeletal muscle mass. However, only the Mediterranean pattern exhibited a correlation with sarcopenia (r =  - 0.17, p = 0.02). The highest tertile of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern demonstrated significantly higher handgrip strength compared to the lowest tertile (III Tertile: 28.3 ± 0.5 kg vs I Tertile: 26.3 ± 0.5 kg; p = 0.01). Furthermore, even after adjustment, the highest tertile of adherence to the Mediterranean pattern showed a significantly lower prevalence of sarcopenia than the lowest adherence tertile (4% vs 16%, p = 0.04). The lowest adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with increased odds of having low muscle strength (OR = 2.38; p = 0.03; 95%CI = 1.05-5.37) and sarcopenia (OR = 9.69; p = 0.0295; %CI = 1.41-66.29). CONCLUSION: A high adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, characterized by increased consumption of legumes, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and limited amounts of meat, fish, and eggs, is positively associated with handgrip strength and appendicular skeletal muscle mass. The highest adherence to this dietary model is associated with the lowest odds of low muscle strength and sarcopenia. Despite the changes brought about by urbanization in southern Italy compared to the past, our findings continue to affirm the superior benefits of the Mediterranean diet in postponing the onset of frailty among older adults when compared to other dietary patterns that are rich in animal foods."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenic dysphagia is characterized by weakness of swallowing-related muscles associated with whole-body sarcopenia. As the number of patients with sarcopenia increases with the aging of the world, the number of patients with sarcopenic dysphagia is also increasing. The prevalence of sarcopenic dysphagia is high in the institutionalized older people and in patients hospitalized for pneumonia with dysphagia in acute care hospitals. Prevention, early detection and intervention of sarcopenic dysphagia with rehabilitation nutrition are essential. The diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia is based on skeletal and swallowing muscle strength and muscle mass. A reliable and validated diagnostic algorithm for sarcopenic dysphagia is used. Sarcopenic dysphagia is associated with malnutrition, which leads to mortality and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) decline. The rehabilitation nutrition approach improves swallowing function, nutrition status, and ADL. A combination of aggressive nutrition therapy to improve nutrition status, dysphagia rehabilitation, physical therapy, and other interventions can be effective for sarcopenic dysphagia. The rehabilitation nutrition care process is used to assess and problem solve the patient's pathology, sarcopenia, and nutrition status. The simplified rehabilitation nutrition care process consists of a nutrition cycle and a rehabilitation cycle, each with five steps: assessment, diagnosis, goal setting, intervention, and monitoring. Nutrition professionals and teams implement the nutrition cycle. Rehabilitation professionals and teams implement the rehabilitation cycle. Both cycles should be done simultaneously. The nutrition diagnosis of undernutrition, overnutrition/obesity, sarcopenia, and goal setting of rehabilitation and body weight are implemented collaboratively."

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of exercise, protein supplementation, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation in treating cirrhotic sarcopenia. PubMed, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials of exercise, protein supplementation, and/or BCAA supplementation on improving at least one of the sarcopenia features: muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Differences in post- and pre-intervention changes between intervention and control arms were calculated as a standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). A network meta-analysis (NMA), component NMA, pairwise meta-analysis (PW-MA) of 23 trials comprising 1525 participants were performed. By NMA, combined exercise with protein and BCAA supplementations had the greatest effect on increasing muscle mass (SMD 2.12; 95%CI: 0.59-3.65). Exercise alone or with BCAA/protein supplementation also significantly increased muscle mass, but protein or BCAA supplementation alone did not increase muscle mass. By PW-MA, exercise significantly improved physical performance versus control (SMD 1.43; 95%CI: 0.63-2.17; p < 0.01; I² = 59%) and exercise plus protein supplementation was superior to protein alone (SMD 0.66; 95%CI: 0.26-1.06; p = 0.001; I² = 0%). In the systematic review of effects of BCAA supplementation on muscle strength, its impact was inconclusive. Exercise is the mainstay of sarcopenia treatment in cirrhosis and is most effective at improving muscle mass when combined with protein and BCAA supplementation. Nutritional supplementation alone does not enhance muscle mass. Further well-designed studies are needed to identify the most effective type of exercise."

Nutritional interventions have been explored for its management, but the comparative efficacy of these interventions remains unclear. This study synthesizes current evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for sarcopenia in cirrhosis. METHODS: Data sources included Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library up to Dec 2024. Eligible trials compared different nutritional interventions against control diets, placebos, or each other. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to combine direct and indirect evidence. Effect sizes were calculated as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Intervention rankings were assessed using P-score, and evidence quality was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: A total of 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,437 patients met the inclusion criteria. For improving muscle mass (MAMC), post-paracentesis intravenous nutritional support combined with an oral nutritional protocol (Treat A) showed the greatest effect compared to high-calorie, high-protein diets (HCHP) (MD: 2.78 cm, 95% CI: 1.15 to 4.40, low certainty), and oral nutritional protocol (Treat B) (MD of 3.41 cm, 95% CI: 2.12, 4.69). For muscle strength, the HINT diet (MD: 8.01 kg, 95% CI: 7.64 to 8.37, low certainty) and the HCHP (MD: 5 kg, 95% CI: 3.90 to 6.10, low certainty) were more effective than control diets. HCHP also demonstrated greater handgrip improvement than the HINT diet (MD: 3.00 kg, 95% CI: 1.84, 4.16; low certainty evidence). BCAA combined with vitamin D (2000 IU once a day) significantly improved skeletal muscle index (SMI) compared to both BCAA (MD: 0.72 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: 0.11 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) and placebo (MD: 0.25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.05; very low certainty evidence). BCAA supplementation effectively improved handgrip strength compared to placebo (MD: 2.36 kg, 95% CI: 1.85, 2.88; low certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Post-paracentesis intravenous nutritional support combined with an oral nutritional protocol effectively improves muscle mass, while high-calorie, high-protein diets enhance handgrip strength. BCAA supplementation alone or with vitamin D has been shown to effectively enhance muscle strength and muscle mass. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to low evidence certainty."

Our purpose was to investigate the effects of metabolic risk factors on sarcopenia in older adults. METHODS: Sixteen studies were found through a search of electronic databases and were subjected to a meta-analysis to investigate the differences in metabolic risk factors between patients with sarcopenia and controls. The random-effects standardized mean difference ±95% confidence interval was calculated as the effect size. RESULTS: The results showed that body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), triglycerides (TG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total cholesterol (d=3.252, d=2.039, d=2.956, d=2.579, d=2.123, d=1.195, d=-0.991, and d=1.007, respectively) all had relationships with sarcopenia. In addition, the effect sizes of all male groups for all variables were higher than those of the female groups. However, only the between-sex effect size of HOMA-IR (<i>P</i><0.01) was significant, while those for BMI, fasting glucose, SBP, DBP, TG, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol were not. Finally, the metabolic risk factors appeared to be significantly related to loss of skeletal muscle. CONCLUSION: Nutrition and appropriate exercise to enhance muscle strength and quality in the elderly reduce the occurrence of sarcopenia, thereby reducing the incidence of metabolic diseases."

This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on the association between protein intake and sarcopenia-related outcomes among Korean older adults and identify current research trends and gaps in this field. The review followed the 5-step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist to ensure a comprehensive search strategy. Protein intake was assessed using various methods, including grams per day, grams per kilogram of body weight per day, and intake quartiles. Sarcopenia-related outcomes were categorized into 3 domains as follows: muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. Although most intervention studies demonstrated improvements in muscle mass following protein supplementation, findings on muscle strength and physical function were inconsistent. Cross-sectional studies generally reported better sarcopenia-related outcomes with higher protein intake, particularly when the intake was expressed relative to body weight or analyzed according to quartiles. However, heterogeneity in protein intake assessments and variations in sarcopenia definitions could have contributed to the inconsistent findings across studies. This review highlights the need for applying standardized approaches for protein intake measurement and sarcopenia diagnosis. Future studies should consider the quantity, quality, and timing of protein intake while also focusing on the implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary intervention strategies to promote healthy aging among Korean older adults."

SUBJECTS: The study included 986 men and women of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, with a mean age of 74.6 years (standard deviation 6.2). METHODS: Grip strength (n = 986) and appendicular muscle mass (n = 328, using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) were obtained in 1995 and 1996 and repeated after a 3-year follow-up. Loss of muscle strength was defined as a loss of grip strength greater than 40%, and sarcopenia was defined as a loss of muscle mass greater than 3%, approximating the lowest 15% of the study sample. RESULTS: Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that higher levels of IL-6 were associated with greater decline in muscle strength, which decreased by -3.21 kg (standard error 0.81) per standard deviation increase in log-transformed IL-6. After adjustment for confounders, including sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors, high IL-6 (>5 pg/mL) and high CRP (>6.1 mug/mL) were associated with a 2 to 3-fold greater risk of losing greater than 40% of muscle strength. Persons with high levels of ACT (>181% of the normal human pooled plasma) were 40% less likely to experience loss of muscle strength and tended (P = .07) to have a smaller decline in muscle mass compared with those in the lowest quartile of ACT. No consistent associations of IL-6 and CRP with sarcopenia were found. CONCLUSION: The findings of this prospective, population-based study suggest that higher levels of IL-6 and CRP increase the risk of muscle strength loss, whereas higher levels of ACT decrease the risk of muscle strength loss in older men and women."

Identification of factors associated with UI is necessary to identify risky individuals, to take preventive measures, and to recognize commonly associated co-morbidities. We suggest that sarcopenia may be associated with UI through decrease in muscle mass/strength. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between UI (stress and/or urgency) and sarcopenia. METHODS: Female older adults ≥ 60 years that applied to geriatric outpatient clinic were analyzed cross-sectionally. The presence of UI, UI types, fecal incontinence, and constipation was obtained. Functional status was assessed by basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL and IADL), nutrition by mini-nutritional assessment-short form (MNA-SF). Total muscle mass was measured by bioimpedance analysis. Hand grip strength and walking speed were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 802 female adults were included. The prevalence of UI was 48.9%. Associated factors with presence of UI were higher age and BMI, presence of fecal incontinence, constipation, lower activities of ADL and IADL scores, lower grip strength, lower skeletal muscle mass adjusted by weight and BMI, and presence of sarcopenia adjusted by weight and BMI. Independent factors related with UI were presence of fecal incontinence, constipation, IADL dependency, low muscle mass adjusted by weight and body mass index, and sarcopenia adjusted by weight. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that UI is independently associated with sarcopenia when muscle mass was adjusted by weight and also with presence of low muscle mass when muscle mass was adjusted by weight or BMI."

This study aimed to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic subjects. 120 men and women were selected out from the cross-sectional study 'sarcopenia and its determinants among Iranian elders' (SARIR). Sarcopenia was defined based on the first 'European Working Group on sarcopenia in older people' (EWGSOP<sub>1</sub>) guidelines. A fasting blood sample was taken from each participant to measure serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). A total of 120 participants were included in this study. Mean age was 66.7 ± 7.7 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.3 ± 4.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Forty participants had the criteria of EWGSOP<sub>1</sub> sarcopenia. A statistically significant difference was seen between normal and abnormal groups of muscle strength in hs-CRP (P-value = 0.04). Furthermore, we did not observe any remarkable association between inflammatory biomarkers including IL-6 (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.31-4.28), TNF-α (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.17-2.77), and hs-CRP (OR 2.39; 95% CI 0.87-6.55) and the presence of sarcopenia even after controlling for plausible confounders. We found that inflammatory biomarkers level was not associated with odds of sarcopenia. The lack of correlation between inflammatory cytokines and sarcopenia could be due to the participants' age and genetics. Future studies are required to confirm these findings."

            "abstract": "The growing recognition of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, has highlighted the need to understand more about its etiology. Declines in muscle mass and strength are expected aspects of aging, but there is significant variability between individuals in rates of loss. Although some of these differences can be explained by fixed factors, such as sex, much of the remaining variation is unexplained. This has led to increasing interest in the influence of adult lifestyle, particularly in the effects of modifiable factors such as physical activity and diet, and in identifying intervention opportunities both to prevent and manage sarcopenia. A number of trials have examined the separate effects of increased exercise or dietary supplementation on muscle mass and physical performance of older adults, but less is known about the extent to which benefits of exercise training could be enhanced when these interventions are combined. In a comprehensive review of the literature, we consider 17 studies of older adults (≥65 years) in which combined nutrition and exercise interventions were used to increase muscle strength and/or mass, and achieve improvements in physical performance. The studies were diverse in terms of the participants included (nutritional status, degree of physical frailty), supplementation strategies (differences in nutrients, doses), exercise training (type, frequency), as well as design (duration, setting). The main message is that enhanced benefits of exercise training, when combined with dietary supplementation, have been shown in some trials - indicating potential for future interventions, but that existing evidence is inconsistent. Further studies are needed, particularly of exercise training combined with dietary strategies that increase intakes of a range of nutrients, as well as bioactive non-nutrients, to provide the evidence on which public health and clinical recommendations can be based."

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of this combination on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of 4 electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the MEDLINE Library. The search covered literature from January 2013 to January 2023 and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each study using the standard critical appraisal tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Meta-analysis was performed with the JBI Sumari program. RESULTS: The review included 7 randomized controlled trials and 1 quasi-experimental study, encompassing a total of 854 participants aged 60 years and above. The study durations ranged from 10 weeks to 24 weeks. An analysis of standardized mean differences (SMDs) showed that protein supplementation combined with resistance exercise significantly increased muscle mass (SMD, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 1.78; p<0.05) and muscle strength (SMD, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.56; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the limited number of randomized controlled trials restricts the robustness of our conclusions, the evidence suggests that protein supplementation combined with resistance exercise is effective in enhancing muscle mass and strength in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia."

Mounting evidences showed that stroke-related sarcopenia might promote the occurrence and development of sarcopenia through various pathogenesis such as muscle atrophy, dysphagia, inflammation, and malnutrition, etc. At present, the main indicators used to assess malnutrition in patients with stroke-related sarcopenia include temporalis muscle thickness, calf circumference, phase angle, geriatric nutritional risk index and mini-nutritional assessment short-form, etc. Currently, there is no particularly effective method to curb its progression, but supplementation with essential amino acids, whey protein combined with vitamin D, high energy diet, avoiding Polypharmacy, as well as increasing physical activity level and reducing sedentary lifestyle may improve the malnutrition status of stroke patients, and increase the muscle mass and skeletal muscle index, further delay or even prevent the development of stroke-related sarcopenia. This article reviews the latest research progress on the characteristics, epidemiology, pathogenesis and the role of nutrition in stroke-related sarcopenia, so as to provide reference for the clinical treatment and rehabilitation of stroke-related sarcopenia."

First, we introduce the topic of sarcopenia and its estimated prevalence in patients with CVD. Then, we critically analyse the available evidence to support the use of exercise and nutrition, both alone and combined, for treating sarcopenia in patients with CVD followed by discussing factors that may optimise management. We further discuss the relevance of how medications used in CVD impact sarcopenia and how they may negatively interact with exercise/nutritional interventions. Finally, we provide insights into the practical implications and future directions for managing sarcopenia in patients with CVD. In summary, optimised physical exercise interventions (dedicated resistance training in addition to endurance training and other modalities) together with adequate nutritional intake (avoiding malnutrition and ensuring sufficient protein consumption) is advised for the prevention and management of sarcopenia. However, there currently remains a lack of high-quality evidence to support these approaches in the context of CVD, where baseline sarcopenia status has typically not been evaluated. Future work, therefore, is required in CVD populations with confirmed sarcopenia to better understand what optimal exercise and nutritional strategies are required to further improve sarcopenia management."

This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with skeletal muscle strength, mass and sarcopenia, particularly protein intake, and to assess whether shared twin characteristics are important. METHODS: This study utilised cross-sectional data from a study of community-dwelling twins aged ≥60 years. Multivariable logistic regression and between- and within-twin pair regression modelling were used. RESULTS: Participants (n = 3,302) were 89% female (n = 2,923), aged a mean of 72.1 (±7.3) years and composed of 858 (55%) monozygotic, 709 (45%) dizygotic twin pairs and 168 individual lone twins. Using optimal protein intake as the reference group (1.0-1.3 g/kg/day), there was no significant association between protein intake (neither high nor low) and low muscle strength, or between low protein intake and sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR) 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.25; P = 0.229) in unadjusted models. High protein intake (>1.3 g/kg/day) was associated with low muscle mass (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.39-2.24; P < 0.0001), while low protein intake was protective (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.40-0.67; P < 0.0001). High protein intake was associated with sarcopenia (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.21-3.44; P = 0.008), and this was robust to adjustment for demographic, anthropometric and dietary factors. The association between muscle strength and weight, body mass index, healthy eating index, protein intake and alpha diversity was not significantly influenced by shared twin factors, indicating greater amenability to interventions. CONCLUSIONS: High protein intake is associated with sarcopenia in a cohort of healthy older twins."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive, age-related condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. As Asia faces rapid population aging, sarcopenia has become an urgent public health concern. Over time, definitions and diagnostic criteria have evolved to emphasize muscle strength and physical performance rather than muscle mass alone. This review summarizes key updates in global and regional frameworks, including guidelines from the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) and the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS 2019). However, these strategies might be updated along with the release of AWGS 2025. We also review current methods for evaluating muscle health. Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) remains a standard, it has limitations in reflecting true muscle quality and predicting outcomes. Novel techniques like deuterium-labeled creatine dilution show promise for more accurate assessment. The review highlights emerging muscle-related biomarkers-myokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), irisin, myostatin, and gelsolin-which may improve diagnostic precision and therapeutic strategies. The Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia (GLIS) introduced the first globally endorsed definition, incorporating muscle mass, strength, muscle-specific strength, and physical performance as a key outcome in 2024. This unified approach supports standardized diagnosis across clinical and research settings. Addressing sarcopenia alongside other age-related conditions is essential to prevent frailty and disability. Finally, the targeted multidomain interventions-particularly physical activity and nutrition-are critical for preserving function and quality of life in older adults."

Inclusion criteria included diet quality assessment via dietary indices or statistical approaches, a sample of adults aged 45 years and over at baseline in a longitudinal study design. (3) Results: Of the 22,885 cohort studies, 14 studies were eligible. Meaningful results were obtained for the Mediterranean diet and Nordic diet regarding the decrease of sarcopenia risk, however results from non-European countries were inconsistent. In addition, due to the insufficient number of studies on Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top (JFG-ST), dietary variety score (DVS), and dietary quality index-international (DQI-I), effectiveness was difficult to prove. Studies using factor analysis to examine dietary patterns suggested that the risk of sarcopenia is increased with a high in saturated fat diet such as westernized pattern etc. (4) Conclusion: In this systematic review it was found that various diet qualities are meaningful to a decreased risk of sarcopenia."

Oral frailty is age-related decline of oral function in older adults. Presbyphagia and oral frailty are not dysphagia but frailty of oral and swallowing function. Oral sarcopenia is defined as sarcopenia in muscles of the oral cavity. Sarcopenic dysphagia is characterized by swallowing difficulty resulting from a loss of mass and function in whole-body skeletal and swallowing muscles. Sarcopenic dysphagia is diagnosed using a 5-step algorithm for sarcopenic dysphagia. Iatrogenic sarcopenia can be one of the causes of sarcopenic dysphagia. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is defined as sarcopenia caused by the activities of medical staff including doctors, nurses, or other health care professionals in healthcare facilities. Iatrogenic sarcopenia has three categories:1)activity-related:caused by unnecessary inactivity or unnecessary nil per os, 2)nutrition-related:caused by inappropriate nutritional care management, and 3)disease-related:in case of iatrogenic diseases. Rehabilitation nutrition is recommended for preventing and treating sarcopenic dysphagia. Rehabilitation nutrition is defined as that which 1)evaluates holistically by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and the presence and cause of nutritional disorders, sarcopenia, and excess or deficiency of nutritional intake;2)conducts rehabilitation nutrition diagnosis and rehabilitation nutrition goal setting;and 3)elicits the highest body functions, activities, participations, and quality of life by improving nutritional status, sarcopenia, and frailty using 'nutrition care management in consideration of rehabilitation' and 'rehabilitation in consideration of nutrition' in people with a disability and frail older people. Rehabilitation nutrition can be practiced by using the rehabilitation nutrition care process, which is a systematic problem-solving method. It consists of five steps:rehabilitation nutrition assessment and diagnostic reasoning, rehabilitation nutrition diagnosis, rehabilitation nutrition goal setting, rehabilitation nutrition intervention, and rehabilitation nutrition monitoring."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function, commonly affects older adults and reduces their quality of life. Frequent consumption of ultra-processed foods, which contain mostly additives and very few natural foods, increases the risk of sarcopenia or accelerates its onset. A diet rich in ultra-processed foods may lead to inadequate nutrition and lower intake of many nutrients, such as protein, dietary fiber, vitamins A, C, E, zinc, selenium, magnesium, and iron. However, obesity may occur because of increased energy and saturated fat intake. Both conditions contribute to the risk of muscle mass loss. A diet poor in antioxidants may increase the risk of sarcopenia by increasing inflammation. The fact that consumption of ultra-processed food contributes to the risk of frailty in older adults may lead to increased physical weakness and falls. Therefore, minimizing the consumption of ultra-processed foods is important to reduce the risk of sarcopenia. Understanding the contribution of the nutrients in this group to the risk of sarcopenia will allow for more accurate nutritional recommendations for old age. In our world, where the elderly population is increasing, it is important to conduct studies that include healthy nutrition to make this process healthier and more prosperous."

A multidisciplinary working group completed a review of the literature, focused on evidence-based guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to develop recommendations for the position statement. National consultation of the position statement content was undertaken through COSA members. All people with cancer should be screened for malnutrition and sarcopenia in all health settings at diagnosis and as the clinical situation changes throughout treatment and recovery. People identified as \"at risk\" of malnutrition or with a high-risk cancer diagnosis or treatment plan should have a comprehensive nutrition assessment; people identified as \"at risk\" of sarcopenia should have a comprehensive evaluation of muscle status using a combination of assessments for muscle mass, muscle strength and function. All people with cancer-related malnutrition and sarcopenia should have access to the core components of treatment, including medical nutrition therapy, targeted exercise prescription and physical and psychological symptom management. Treatment for cancer-related malnutrition and sarcopenia should be individualised, in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team (MDT), and tailored to meet needs at each stage of cancer treatment. Health services should ensure a broad range of health care professionals across the MDT have the skills and confidence to recognise malnutrition and sarcopenia to facilitate timely referrals and treatment. The position statement is expected to provide guidance at a national level to improve the multidisciplinary management of cancer-related malnutrition and sarcopenia."

Sparse clinical data on non-sarcopenic individuals indicate that vitamin D alone has a subtle beneficial effect on knee extensor strength at doses 880-1600 IU/day without improving handgrip strength or muscle mass. When co-administered with other supplements such as protein, mixed effects appear to prevent the decline of muscle mass, possibly delaying the onset of sarcopenia in non-sarcopenic individuals, at doses of 800-1,000 IU/day over 6-12 weeks. In sarcopenic individuals, vitamin D 100-1,000 IU/day co-supplementation with protein results in increased handgrip strength between 9.8-40.5%. However, there is no strong clinical evidence that vitamin D dosage correlates with changes in muscle strength or mass. Potential sources of discrepancy among studies are discussed. Future studies with appropriate experimental design are essential to dissect the net effect of vitamin D on sarcopenia."

To develop preventive strategies, a better understanding is needed of the lifestyle factors that influence sarcopenia and the mechanisms involved. Existing evidence indicates the potential importance of diets of adequate quality, to ensure sufficient intakes of protein, vitamin D, and antioxidant nutrients. Although much of this evidence is observational, the prevalence of low nutrient intakes and poor status among older adults make this a current concern. However, as muscle mass and strength in later life are a reflection of both the rate of muscle loss and the peak attained in early life, efforts to prevent sarcopenia also need to consider diet across the lifecourse and the potential effectiveness of early interventions. Optimising diet and nutrition throughout life may be key to preventing sarcopenia and promoting physical capability in older age."

Objective: to analyze the nutritional problematic related to frailty and sarcopenia in older adults. Methods: a literature review, about particularities of frailty and sarcopenia, diagnosis and nutritional treatment, has been carried out. Results: frailty is a geriatric syndrome that can be identified by at least three of the following criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, reduced physical activity, increased walk time, low grip strength. Sarcopenia is a muscular disease characterized by low muscle mass and reduced muscle strength as the main determinant. Both conditions can benefit from adequate protein intake (1-1.5 g/kg/day) and regular physical activity. Conclusion: identification, prevention, monitoring and nutritional treatment of frailty and sarcopenia in older adults is important because of its high prevalence. The main goal is to maintain the muscular integrity and minimize muscle loss in older adults. A healthy aging includes regular physical activity and the fulfillment of the protein requirements of this population."

            "abstract": "Menopause is associated with a decline in estrogen levels, which could lead to an increase in visceral adiposity as well as a decrease in bone density, muscle mass and muscle strength. This decline in muscle mass, known as sarcopenia, is frequently observed in postmenopausal women. Potential causes of sarcopenia include age-related changes in the hormonal status, low levels of physical activity, reduced protein intake and increased oxidative stress. However, the role of sex hormones, specifically estrogens, on the onset of sarcopenia is controversial. Preventing sarcopenia and preserving muscle strength are highly relevant in order to prevent functional impairment and physical disability. To date, resistance training has been shown to be effective in attenuating age-related muscle loss and strength. However, results on the effect of hormonal supplementation to treat or prevent sarcopenia are contradictory. Further research is needed to identify other potential mechanisms of sarcopenia as well as effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Therefore, the purpose of this review will be to examine the role of sex hormonal status in the development of sarcopenia. We will also overview the physical as well as metabolic consequences of sarcopenia and the efficiency of different interventions for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia."

We evaluated the development of trends in this field using a bibliometric analysis. Articles up to July 2022 were searched in the Scopus database. Bibliographic information from the selected publications, such as countries, citations, world maps, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords, were converted and analyzed automatically using the \"bibliometrix\" package in R environment (version 4.2.0). We identified 368 Scopus articles from 1998-2021. According to citation analyses, 27 documents received more than 100 citations. Bibliometric analysis based on the literature included in this study revealed that South Korea (61 publications), United States (50), Japan (35), China (30), and Italy (20) contributed the most publications. Tehran University of Medical Science (19 records, 2.55% of articles) contributed the most publications. The most productive author was Landi, with eight articles (2.17% of articles). The publications were located in 196 journals, with <i>Nutrients</i> having the most publications (30, 8.15% of articles). The curves representing keywords \"sarcopenia\" and \"aged\" were the most apparent. Our analysis suggested that global nutrition and sarcopenia-related research increased rapidly from 2001 to 2021, demonstrating that this was a promising area of future research that could benefit from continued advances. Future research may focus on the effects of age and sex as well as intervention effectiveness, particularly exercise and nutrition supplementation."

            "abstract": "Research in sarcopenia has grown exponentially over the last 15 years in geriatrics and gerontology, as well as other specialties, including oncology and hepatology. There is now strong evidence for the role of resistance exercise to prevent declines in muscle strength and function, especially when combined with nutritional optimization with protein supplementation. However, there remains a disparity between research evidence and clinical practice. There are multiple factors for this, which relate to the current diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, practical and logistical aspects of diagnosis of sarcopenia, clinician knowledge of both diagnosis and management, and the availability of pathways for interventions. Sarcopenia is currently defined based on the identification of muscle strength, in combination with muscle size or quality, below cut-off thresholds at a single timepoint. This defines sarcopenia as a binary process of either present or not present, thus early diagnosis can be challenging. In this article, we summarize current obstacles to early diagnosis and management of sarcopenia in clinical practice, and make recommendations to how these might be overcome. This includes our recommendation of incorporation of handgrip strength measurement into standard care, to enable dynamic assessment and identification of early declines in handgrip strength, so that interventions can be implemented to prevent disability."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is defined as the progressive loss of muscle mass with age, and poses a serious threat to the physiological and psychological health of the elderly population with consequential economic and social burdens. Chronic low-grade inflammation plays a central role in the development of sarcopenia such that it alters cellular protein metabolism to favor proteolysis over synthesis, and thereby accelerates muscular atrophy. The purpose of this review is to highlight how exercise and nutrition intervention strategies can attenuate or treat sarcopenia. Resistance exercise increases not only muscle mass but also muscle strength, while aerobic exercise is able to ameliorate the age-related metabolic disorders. Concurrent exercise training integrates the advantages of both aerobic and resistance exercise, and may exert a significant synergistic effect in the aging organism. Higher protein intakes rich in the amino acid leucine appear to restore skeletal muscle protein metabolism balance by rescuing protein synthesis in older adults. There is good reason to believe that a multimodal treatment, a combination of exercise and increased leucine consumption in the diet, can combat some of the muscle loss associated with aging. Future research is needed to consolidate these findings to humans, and to further clarify to what extent and by which mechanisms protein metabolism might be directly involved in sarcopenia pathogenesis and the multimodal treatment responses."

It results from a complex interplay of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, physical inactivity, hypoxia, malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, and structural muscle remodeling, all contributing to muscle catabolism and impaired regeneration. These factors form a vicious cycle that worsens functional decline, highlighting the need for multifaceted, integrated therapeutic approaches. Sarcopenia in COPD is a measurable, modifiable, and treatable trait linked to worse lung function, physical performance, and outcomes. Early detection using the EWGSOP2 algorithm, starting with SARC-F screening, muscle strength testing, and confirmation via imaging and targeted interventions, can enable timely, effective interventions to improve outcomes. Targeted sarcopenia treatment in COPD includes pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional support, and behavioral strategies. Exercise and high-protein, vitamin D-rich diets improve muscle strength and function. Pharmacological options remain experimental. Multidisciplinary care involving pulmonologists, physiotherapists, dietitians, and primary care providers ensures early detection, individualized treatment, and better outcomes through integrated interventions that address both respiratory impairment and muscle loss. Despite promising advances, key research gaps remain in sarcopenia as a treatable trait in COPD, including the need for standardized diagnostic criteria, longitudinal studies, optimal intervention strategies, and integration of functional outcomes. Future research should prioritize equity, mechanistic insights, and implementation science to refine personalized care and improve clinical outcomes in COPD."

Within the normal range of serum phosphate, we used quartile-based analyses to determine the potential relationships of serum phosphate with dynapenia, and sarcopenia through multivariate regression models. After adjusting for the pertinent variables, an inverse association between the serum phosphate quartiles and muscle strength was observed and the linear association was stronger than other anthropometric parameters. Notably, the significant association between phosphate and muscle strength was existed in >65 years old age group, not in 20-65 years old. The higher quartiles of phosphate had higher likelihood for predicting the presence of dynapenia rather than sarcopenia in entire population. Our study highlighted that higher quartiles of phosphate had significant association with lower muscle strength and higher risks for predicting the presence of dynapenia."

            "abstract": "Lower limb muscle dysfunction is a key driver for impaired physical capacity and frailty status, both characteristics of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is the key pathway between frailty and disability. Identifying biological markers for early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention may be key to early intervention and prevention of disability particularly mobility issues. To identify biological markers associated with lower limb muscle (dys)function in adults with sarcopenia, a systematic literature search was conducted in AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases from inception to 17 November 2021. Title, abstract, and full-text screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently and verified by a third reviewer. Depending on available data, associations are reported as either Pearson's correlations, regression R<sup>2</sup> or partial R<sup>2</sup> , P value, and sample size (n). Twenty eligible studies including 3306 participants were included (females: 79%, males: 15%, unreported: 6%; mean age ranged from 53 to 92 years) with 36% in a distinct sarcopenic subgroup (females: 73%, males: 19%, unreported: 8%; mean age range 55-92 years). A total of 119 biomarkers were reported, categorized into: genetic and microRNAs (n = 64), oxidative stress (n = 10), energy metabolism (n = 18), inflammation (n = 7), enzyme (n = 4), hormone (n = 7), bone (n = 3), vitamin (n = 2), and cytokine (n = 4) markers) and seven lower limb muscle measures predominately focused on strength. Seven studies reported associations between lower limb muscle measures including (e.g. power, force, and torque) and biomarkers. In individuals with sarcopenia, muscle strength was positively associated with free testosterone (r = 0.40, P = 0.01; n = 46). In analysis with combined sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic individuals, muscle strength was positively associated with combined genetic and methylation score (partial R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.122, P = 0.03; n = 48) and negatively associated with sarcopenia-driven methylation score (partial R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.401, P < 0.01; n = 48). Biomarkers related to genetics (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.001-0.014, partial R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.013-0.122, P > 0.05; n = 48), oxidative stress (r = 0.061, P > 0.05; n ≥ 77), hormone (r = 0.01, ρ = 0.052 p > 0.05, n ≥ 46) and combined protein, oxidative stress, muscle performance, and hormones (R<sup>2</sup>  = 22.0, P > 0.05; n ≥ 82) did not report significant associations with lower limb muscle strength. Several biomarkers demonstrated associations with lower limb muscle dysfunction. The current literature remains difficult to draw clear conclusions on the relationship between biomarkers and lower limb muscle dysfunction in adults with sarcopenia. Heterogeneity of biomarkers and lower limb muscle function precluded direct comparison. Use of international classification of sarcopenia and a set of core standardized outcome measures should be adopted to aid future investigation and recommendations to be made."

We studied how dietary components and physical activity affect individuals with sarcopenia and MAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a study utilizing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1994) data with Linked Mortality file (through 2019). The diagnosis of fatty liver disease (FLD) was based on ultrasound images revealing moderate and severe steatosis. Using bioelectrical measures, sarcopenia was assessed. Using self-report data, dietary intake and physical activity levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 12,259 participants, 2,473 presented with MAFLD, and 290 of whom had sarcopenia. Higher levels of physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51 [0.36-0.95]) and calorie (OR = 0.58 [0.41-0.83]) intake reduced the likelihood of sarcopenia in MAFLD patients. During a median follow-up period of 15.3 years, 1,164 MAFLD and 181 MAFLD patients with sarcopenia perished. Increased activity levels improved the prognosis of patients with sarcopenia (Insufficiently active, HR = 0.75 [0.58-0.97]; Active, HR = 0.64 [0.48-0.86]), which was particularly pronounced in older patients. CONCLUSION: In the general population, hyperglycemia was highly related to MAFLD prognosis. Physical inactivity and a protein-restricted diet corresponded to sarcopenia, with physical inactivity being connected to poor outcomes. Adding protein supplements would be beneficial for older people with sarcopenia who are unable to exercise due to frailty, while the survival benefits were negligible."

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between antioxidant-rich foods (A-RF) and sarcopenia (muscle mass, strength, and function) based on observational studies (OS), and to assess the effectiveness of antioxidant interventions in ≥55-year-old adults via randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, to confirm if the OS results were in accordance with the RCTs results. METHODS: We searched in the MEDLINE®/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases from 2000 to 2020 about sarcopenia and specific nutrients/foods. The risk of bias was assessed and meta-analyses were performed using the Review Manager program. RESULTS: The systematic review included 28 studies (19 OS, 9 RCTs), whereas the meta-analysis included 4 RCTs. Results of the systematic review of OS revealed that higher A-RF consumption was associated with better sarcopenia outcomes. Results of the RCTs meta-analysis indicated that higher fruit/vegetable consumption, supplementation with magnesium, and vitamin E plus vitamin D and protein significantly reduced the time to complete 5 stands (mean difference; 95% CI; -1.11 s; 1.70, -0.51; p < 0.01). Additionally, including tea catechin supplementation significantly increased handgrip strength (1.02 kg; 0.60, 1.44; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In sum, A-RF or antioxidant supplementation could be effective tools for sarcopenia, especially improving muscle strength and function. The best interventions according to the meta-analysis of the RCTs were supplementation of vitamin E in combination with vitamin D and protein, magnesium, tea catechins, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This comprehensive review aims to examine the reciprocal interplay between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and sarcopenia, identify prevailing research gaps, and discuss therapeutic approaches and measures to enhance healthcare practices within hospital settings. METHODS: A thorough literature review was conducted to gather relevant studies and articles on the relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia. Various databases were searched, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The search terms included T2DM, sarcopenia, inflammation, insulin resistance, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, muscle dimensions, muscle strength, muscle performance, aging, nutrition, hormone levels, and physical activity. The collected articles were critically analysed to extract key findings and identify gaps in current research. RESULTS: The prevalence and incidence of metabolic and musculoskeletal disorders, notably T2DM and sarcopenia, have surged in recent years. T2DM is marked by inflammation, insulin resistance, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and oxidative stress, while sarcopenia involves a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function. The review underscores the age-related correlation between sarcopenia and adverse outcomes like fractures, falls, and mortality. Research gaps regarding optimal nutritional interventions for individuals with T2DM and sarcopenia are identified, emphasizing the necessity for further investigation in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The reciprocal interplay between T2DM and sarcopenia holds significant importance. Further research is warranted to address knowledge gaps, particularly in utilizing precise measurement tools during clinical trials.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The relationship among gut microbiota, sarcopenia components, and influencing factors in female sarcopenic patients has been poorly investigated. METHODS: Female participants completed questionnaires of physical activity and dietary frequency and were assessed for the presence of sarcopenia by the Asian Working Group of Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019) criteria. Fecal samples were collected from 17 sarcopenia and 30 non-sarcopenia subjects for 16S sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) detection. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 19.20% among 276 participants. The dietary protein, fat, dietary fiber, vitamin B1, niacin, vitamin E, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, and cooper intake of sarcopenia were all remarkably low. In addition, the richness of gut microbiota (Chao1 and ACE indexes) was considerably reduced in sarcopenic patients, and the sarcopenic gut microbiota and its metabolite were decreased in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, Agathobacter, Dorea and Butyrate and were enriched in Shigella and Bacteroides. Correlation analysis showed that Agathobacter and Acetate were positively correlated with grip strength and gait speed, respectively, and Bifidobacterium was negatively correlated with grip strength and appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI). Moreover, the protein intake was positively related to Bifidobacterium. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study revealed the alterations of gut microbiota composition, SCFA, and nutrient intake in women with sarcopenia and their relation to sarcopenic components. These results provide insights into further studies on the role of nutrition and gut microbiota in sarcopenia and its use as a therapeutic approach."

These changes of body composition constitute a relevant predisposition for the imminent loss of functionality and autonomy in older age. In this context adequate nutrition and the prevention of malnutrition play an essential role. As the older population is extremely heterogeneous with regard to the velocity and extent of aging processes and also with regard to comorbidities, recommendations for adequate nutrition have to be individualized. Even voluntary loss of weight may be critical as it may accelerate the development of sarcopenia. As a general rule periods of fasting should be avoided. This is especially true with regard to inadequate caloric intake in the course of acute and chronic diseases. Therefore, weight measurements should be performed regularly in older persons, which would allow early diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition. In comparison to younger adults a higher protein intake of 1.0 g/kg bodyweight is recommended for older persons, as this may slow their decline of muscle mass and muscle function. If sarcopenia is already present, the recommended protein intake is raised towards 1.2 g/kg bodyweight. While restrictive are diets may be detrimental in older persons, healthy diets like the Mediterranean diet may support the preservation of muscular and cognitive function."

METHODS: We searched PubMed-Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials comparing leucine-rich protein supplements with a control intervention in sarcopenic older adults. A pairwise meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed. The primary outcome of interest was muscle strength regardless of the measures used. Effect sizes were computed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials including a total of 699 participants were retrieved. Leucine-rich protein supplements improved participants' overall muscle strength, mass, and performance compared to the control group (SMD = 0.939; 95% CI, 0.440-1.438; P < 0.001). As the primary outcome, muscle strength improved significantly in the leucine group (SMD = 0.794; 95% CI, 0.104-1.485; P = 0.024).

            "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by both obesity and sarcopenia, significantly impacts health and independence of affected individuals. There is an urgent need to explore effective strategies for addressing or preventing sarcopenic obesity. An initial critical step is to promptly assess the impact of academic research in this field, considering factors such as geographical regions, authors, journals, and institutions. It is also essential to analyze current trends and identify potential areas that may inspire future researchers to conduct further studies, ultimately improving public health outcomes for individuals with sarcopenic obesity. To achieve this, bibliometric research was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify English language articles and reviews focusing on sarcopenic obesity interventions published between January 1, 2004, and June 15, 2024, followed by a literature review. A total of 929 English-language articles were collected, consisting of 645 research articles and 284 reviews. Research output in the field has shown significant growth since 2017, reaching a peak of 139 papers in 2022. The United States leads in publication output with 234 papers and a total of 13,971 citations, highlighting substantial international collaboration. Both the United States and Europe are recognized as key academic hubs for sarcopenic obesity intervention research, characterized by robust academic interactions. Moreover, there has been a notable increase in publication volume from China, South Korea, and Japan. Noteworthy authors in this field include Boirie Y from Université Clermont Auvergne in France, Prado CM from the University of Alberta in Canada, Cruz-Jentoft AJ from Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal in Spain, and Prado CM from the University of Alberta, known for their high citation count. The University of Alberta leads in the number of publications, while the University of Verona in Italy leads in citation frequency. Journals with higher publication volumes in sarcopenic obesity intervention include Nutrients, Clinical Nutrition, and Journal of Cachexia Sarcopenia and Muscle. Among the top 20 keywords, the most relevant interventions for sarcopenic obesity are exercise, nutrition, resistance training, physical activity, and muscle strength. The primary evidence currently available suggests that resistance training is the most effective method for enhancing muscle strength in sarcopenic obesity patients. Additionally, combining protein supplementation with resistance exercise has shown encouraging results in reducing fat mass in these individuals. To progress in this field, it is crucial to foster collaboration among countries, regions, and academic institutions, promoting multidisciplinary partnerships."

This study aimed to assess the impact of sarcopenia on functional outcomes and dietary intake during hospitalization in adults undergoing convalescent rehabilitation. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis at a single rehabilitation institution. The Asian Working Group Consensus Criteria for Sarcopenia was used to diagnose. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score was used at hospital discharge to measure the primary functional outcome. Energy and protein intakes during hospitalization were calculated as part of the nutritional assessment. There were 126 patients in the research (median age, 73 yr;54% women). Stroke (n = 73;53.4% sarcopenia) and musculoskeletal disorders (n = 53;56.6% sarcopenia) were among the admission diagnoses. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the FIM total score at discharge was modestly associated with sarcopenia only in stroke patients (? = 0.1872, P = 0.09), as well as significantly and independently associated with protein intake during admission only in stroke patients (? = 0.3217, P < 0.05). In hospitalized stroke patients undergoing convalescent therapy, sarcopenia is related to lower functional results. Early identification of sarcopenia and treatment with rehabilitation nutrition should be implemented in this population. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 457-463, August, 2023."

            "abstract": "Presbyphagia refers to age-related changes in the swallowing mechanism in the elderly associated with a frailty in swallowing. Presbyphagia is different from dysphagia. Sarcopenic dysphagia is difficulty swallowing due to sarcopenia of generalized skeletal muscles and swallowing muscles. Age-related loss of swallowing muscle mass becomes evident in the geniohyoid muscle and tongue. Elderly subjects with both sarcopenia and dysphagia may have not only disease-related dysphagia but also sarcopenic dysphagia. In cases of aspiration pneumonia, deterioration in activity-, disease-, and nutrition-related sarcopenia of generalized skeletal muscles and swallowing muscles may develop into sarcopenic dysphagia. Assessment of sarcopenic dysphagia includes evaluation of both dysphagia and sarcopenia. The 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) and a water test combined with pulse oximetry are useful for dysphagia screening. Assessment of the multi-factorial causes of sarcopenia including nutritional review is important, because rehabilitation of sarcopenic dysphagia differs depending on its etiology. Consensus diagnostic criteria for sarcopenic dysphagia were proposed at the 19th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Dysphagia Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation for sarcopenic dysphagia includes treatment of both dysphagia and sarcopenia. The core components of dysphagia rehabilitation are oral health care, rehabilitative techniques, and food modification. The causes of adult malnutrition may also contribute to the etiology of secondary sarcopenia and sarcopenic dysphagia. Therefore, nutrition management is indispensable for sarcopenic dysphagia rehabilitation. In cases of sarcopenia with numerous complicating causes, treatment should include pharmaceutical therapies for age-related sarcopenia and comorbid chronic diseases, resistance training, early ambulation, nutrition management, protein and amino acid supplementation, and non-smoking."

Subjects with or without sarcopenia were recruited. The anthropometric, muscle strength and endurance measurements were assessed. Muscle proteins (albumin and creatine kinase), myokines (irisin and myostatin), and the coenzyme Q10 level were measured. Approximately half of the subjects suffered from a low coenzyme Q10 concentration (<0.5 μM). The levels of creatinine kinase and irisin were significantly lower in subjects with sarcopenia (p ≤ 0.05). In receiver operating characteristic analyses, irisin and creatine kinase showed a better prediction capability for sarcopenia (area under the curve, irisin: 0.64 vs. creatinine kinase: 0.61) than other biomarkers. Additionally, a low level of irisin (<118.0 ng/mL, odds ratio, 6.46, p < 0.01), creatine kinase (<69.5 U/L, odds ratio, 3.31, p = 0.04), or coenzyme Q10 (<0.67 μM, odds ratio, 9.79, p < 0.01) may increase the risk for sarcopenia even after adjusting for confounders. Since the levels of coenzyme Q10 and muscle biomarkers, such as irisin and creatine kinase, are associated with sarcopenia, we suggest they could be used as candidate markers to assist in the diagnosis of sarcopenia."

Considering this situation, we prepared a position paper outlining basic knowledge, diagnostic and assessment methods, mechanisms, involvement in respiratory diseases, intervention and treatment methods, and future perspectives on respiratory sarcopenia, and summarized the current consensus on respiratory sarcopenia. Respiratory sarcopenia is diagnosed when respiratory muscle weakness and decreased respiratory muscle mass are observed. If respiratory muscle mass is difficult to measure, we can use appendicular skeletal muscle mass as a surrogate. Probable respiratory sarcopenia is defined when respiratory muscle weakness and decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass are observed. If only respiratory muscle strength is decreased without a decrease in respiratory function, the patient is diagnosed with possible respiratory sarcopenia. Respiratory muscle strength is assessed using maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are commonly used to assess respiratory muscle mass; however, there are insufficient data to propose the cutoff values for defining decreased respiratory muscle mass.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigates the impacts of protein-enriched lacto-vegetarian soup supplementation on body composition, physical performance and muscle strength functional assessment as well as cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in older adults. METHODS: We enrolled 100 participants ≥65 years at risk for malnutrition (MNA-SF ≤ 11) and at risk for sarcopenia (SARC-F ≥4 or SARC-CalF ≥11) in this RCT. Participants were randomized assigned to receive a daily protein-enriched lacto-vegetarian soup (24-30 g protein) or usual diet. Primary outcomes of interest including (1) body composition (anthropometric measurements and body composition measured by bioimpedance analysis (BIA)), (2) physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB) and muscle strength (hand grip strength), and (3) functional assessments (including sarcopenia risk scales and nutritional status) as well as secondary outcomes of interests including cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at baseline and the 12th week of follow-up. RESULTS: Data of 97 participants (intervention: n = 48, control: n = 49) were analyzed. Despite no significant changes in body composition were observed in the intervention group, compared to the usual diet, those who received protein-enriched lacto-vegetarian soup supplementation had an improved physical performance including an increase in SPPB score (β = 0.83 [95% CI 0.15-1.51], p = 0.02), a decrease in time to complete the 5 times chair rise test (β = -2.25 [-4.04 to -0.44], p = 0.01). Some functional assessments, including improved sarcopenia risk scale (e.g., SARC-F score [β = -0.68, p = 0.04]) and nutritional status (e.g., MNA-SF score [β = 0.44, p = 0.03]) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with protein-enriched lacto-vegetarian soups enhanced physical performance and functional assessments (such as sarcopenia risk scale and nutritional status) among older adults at risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia. Further study is needed to explore the long-term benefits of protein-enriched lacto-vegetarian soup supplementation for healthy aging."

This study investigated the effects of resistance exercise and nutritional interventions, including antioxidants, such as monoterpenes, on sarcopenia prevention and treatment. METHODS: To identify relevant studies, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. Keywords such as \"sarcopenia,\" \"resistance exercise,\" \"antioxidants,\" \"nutrition,\" \"muscle regeneration,\" and related terms were utilized to gather evidence on the prevention and management of sarcopenia. RESULTS: This review focuses on the etiological factors of sarcopenia, particularly the decline in muscle function and acceleration of muscle protein degradation. This highlights the critical importance of the combined effects of exercise and nutrition in overcoming these challenges, with special emphasis on the potential of antioxidant intake as a promising solution for managing this condition. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach combining periodic resistance exercise with antioxidant-rich nutritional strategies is essential for the management of sarcopenia. By promoting muscle development and inhibiting protein breakdown, this dual strategy provides an effective framework for preventing and treating sarcopenia, and improving quality of life of the aging population. Further studies are warranted to explore the clinical potential of monoterpenes in the treatment of sarcopenia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Reduced muscle mass and strength are prevalent conditions in dialysis patients. However, muscle strength and muscle mass are not congruent; muscle strength can diminish even though muscle mass is maintained or increased. This study addresses phenotype and mortality associations of these muscle dysfunction entities alone or in combination (i.e., concurrent loss of muscle mass and strength/mobility, here defined as sarcopenia). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study included 330 incident dialysis patients (203 men, mean age 53±13 years, and mean GFR 7±2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) recruited between 1994 and 2010 and followed prospectively for up to 5 years. Low muscle mass (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry appendicular mass index) and low muscle strength (by handgrip) were defined against young reference populations according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. RESULTS: Whereas 20% of patients had sarcopenia, low muscle mass and low muscle strength alone were observed in a further 24% and 15% of patients, respectively. Old age, comorbidities, protein-energy wasting, physical inactivity, low albumin, and inflammation associated with low muscle strength, but not with low muscle mass (multivariate ANOVA interactions). During follow-up, 95 patients (29%) died and both conditions associated with mortality as separate entities. When combined, individuals with low muscle mass alone were not at increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.56 to 2.67). Individuals with low muscle strength were at increased risk, irrespective of their muscle stores being appropriate (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.87) or low (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.71). CONCLUSIONS: Low muscle strength was more strongly associated with aging, protein-energy wasting, physical inactivity, inflammation, and mortality than low muscle mass. Assessment of muscle functionality may provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information to muscle-mass evaluation."

Because oxidative stress is proposed to negatively impact upon musculoskeletal aging, we investigated links between human aging and markers of oxidative stress, and relationships to muscle mass and strength in young and old nonsarcopenic and sarcopenic adults. Sixteen young and 16 old males (further subdivided into \"old\" and \"old sarcopenic\") were studied. The abundance of protein carbonyl adducts within skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar, and mitochondrial protein subfractions from musculus vastus lateralis biopsies were determined using Oxyblot immunoblotting techniques. In addition, concentrations of recognized cytoprotective proteins (eg, heat shock proteins [HSP], αβ-crystallin) were also assayed. Aging was associated with increased mitochondrial (but not myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic) protein carbonyl adducts, independently of (stage-I) sarcopenia. Correlation analyses of all subjects revealed that mitochondrial protein carbonyl abundance negatively correlated with muscle strength ([1-repetition maximum], p = .02, r (2) = -.16), but not muscle mass (p = .13, r (2) = -.08). Abundance of cytoprotective proteins, including various HSPs (HSP 27 and 70), were unaffected by aging/sarcopenia. To conclude, these data reveal that mitochondrial protein carbonylation increases moderately with age, and that this increase may impact upon skeletal muscle function, but is not a hallmark of (stage-I) sarcopenia, per se."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia, which is characterized by an age-related decline in muscle mass and function, poses significant challenges to geriatric care. Its definition has evolved from muscle-specific criteria to include muscle mass, muscle function, and physical performance, recognizing sarcopenia as a physical frailty. Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality, falls, fractures, cognitive decline, and admission to long-term care facilities. Neuromechanical factors, protein-energy balance, and muscle protein synthesis-breakdown mechanisms contribute to its pathophysiology. The identification of sarcopenia involves screening tests and a comprehensive assessment of muscle mass, strength, and physical function. Clinical approaches aligned with the principles of comprehensive geriatric assessment prioritize patient-centered care. This assessment aids in identifying issues related to activities of daily living, cognition, mood, nutrition, and social support, alongside other aspects. The general approach to factors underlying muscle loss and functional decline in patients with sarcopenia includes managing chronic diseases and evaluating administered medications, with interventions including exercise and nutrition, as well as evolving pharmacological options. Ongoing research targeting pathways, such as myostatin-activin and exercise mimetics, holds promise for pharmacological interventions. In summary, sarcopenia requires a multifaceted approach, acknowledging its complex etiology and tailoring interventions to individual patient needs."

Studies investigating associations between the risk of reduction in skeletal muscle strength and the amount of dietary protein which is a factor influenced muscle health are scarce, particularly in Asian populations. Therefore, we investigated the association between the amount and change in daily protein intake and the prospective risk of developing low skeletal muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: This study used data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study as an ongoing population-based cohort study of adults aged 40 years and over. The amount of daily protein consumed was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Low skeletal muscle strength was measured with a handgrip strength dynamometer. RESULTS: In total, 32,458 adults (11,358 males and 21,100 females) were evaluated. The amount of daily dietary protein consumed was not associated with the risk of low muscle strength over the 4-year follow-up period after adjusting for covariates. No associations between low muscle strength events according to the change in the amount of protein consumed from the baseline to the follow-up surveys were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of and change in dietary protein consumed were not associated with developing low muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults. Further studies with a focus on physical activity-protein intake interactions and specific conditions, such as mobility-limited adults or hospitalized patients, are warranted to clarify the relationship between protein intake status and the incidence of low skeletal muscle strength."

Sarcopenia is defined as muscle wasting associated with functional impairment. Patients with RA possess significant reduction in muscle strength, caused by muscle protein wasting, and loss of functionality. Various conditions leading to muscle wasting involve different pathways of intracellular signaling that trigger: (i) programmed cell death (apoptosis); (ii) increased protein degradation through autophagy, calcium-dependent proteases (calpains and caspases), and proteasome system; (iii) decreased satellite cell activation, responsible for muscle regeneration. This article aimed at reviewing these general mechanisms of sarcopenia and their involvement in RA. Greater knowledge of these mechanisms may lead to the development of innovative therapies to this important comorbidity."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, a multi-faceted skeletal muscle disorder in the older population, has poor health outcomes. Some previous observational studies investigated the association between circulating inflammatory markers and sarcopenia components to evaluate chronic inflammation as a risk factor for sarcopenia in the elderly population. Nevertheless, the association between circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) and hs-CRP, as the recognized markers of systemic inflammation and components of sarcopenia, is unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association of muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle function with two serum inflammatory markers, circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP). METHODS: We assessed all observational studies across different electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using keywords such as \"muscle strength\", \"muscle mass\", \"muscle function\", CRP and hs-CRP from inception until the 30th of July 2019. Only studies that investigated the association between components of sarcopenia and CRP or hs-CRP levels were included. Participants' country, age, sex, BMI, and screening tool for sarcopenia were retrieved. The correlations between muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle function with CRP, and hs-CRP were expressed as the correlation coefficient (r) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Begg's test and Egger's test were conducted to evaluate risk of publication bias in this study. RESULTS: Initially, we found fifty-nine studies for the qualitative synthesis. Ultimately, nineteen adult cross-sectional studies comprising 14,650 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. Of them, fourteen studies measured the correlation between CRP or hs-CRP and muscle strength. There were significant inverse correlation between CRP and hs-CRP concentrations with muscle strength (ES (z) = -0.22; 95% CI = -0.34 to -0.09; P < 0.001), (ES (z) = -0.22; 95% CI = -0.34 to -0.09; P < 0.001), respectively. No publication bias was found between muscle strength and CRP (P = 0.53) or hs-CRP (P = 0.62) respectively. CONCLUSION: Among diagnostic components of sarcopenia, impairment of muscle strength was independently associated with both inflammatory biomarkers. However, future cohort studies are essential to clarify the causal correlation."

This study investigated the effect of energy supplementation and the combination of anti-inflammatory factor (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA) and muscle-synthesis promotor (branched-chain amino acids; BCAA) on body composition, muscle, and inflammatory biomarkers in elderly with inadequate protein intake. METHODS: A randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 84 elderly with inadequate protein intake. The participants were randomly assigned into four groups receiving a complete nutrition drink; (1) control formula, (2) fortified with 2.2 g EPA, (3) with 2.2 g EPA and 5 g BCAA (2:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val), and (4) with 2.2 g EPA plus 5g BCAA (4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val). Each subject consumed two sachets of the drink to gain 500 kcal/day and performed arm muscle exercises for 3 weeks. Body compositions and handgrip strength were measured using BIA and a dynamometer, respectively. Plasma EPA and BCAA levels were determined using LC-MS/MS to ensure compliance. Muscle protein biomarkers including histidine, β-alanine, and carnosine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Serum inflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) were measured by using ELISA. RESULTS: No symptoms and signs of adverse events were observed. The right arm muscle mass and handgrip strength were significantly increased after consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with EPA + BCAA 2:1:1 and 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and <i>p</i> < 0.01, respectively. Consistently, consuming such combinatory formula non-significantly elevated carnosine with reduced histidine, and increased IL-10 with decreased IL-6. All relevant intervention groups showed a significant increase in plasma levels of BCAA and EPA. CONCLUSION: Consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with 2.2g EPA and 5g BCAA 2:1:1 or 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val for 3 weeks may increase right arm muscle mass and strength in elderly with inadequate protein intake. The tendency of increased dipeptide (carnosine)/decreased free amino acid (histidine) suggests a shift toward muscle protein synthesis. The trend of decreased inflammatory/increased anti-inflammatory cytokines suggests an anti-inflammatory effect. Future long-term studies are warranted to confirm the combinatory effect of BCAA and EPA in the prevention of sarcopenia.

Comparing the combined intervention with a control group, the WMD was 0.20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.56 kg, and 0.08 m/s for SMI, handgrip, and gait speed, respectively, all of which showed a statistically significant improvement. When a combined intervention was compared with exercise and nutrition, the former resulted in improvements in handgrip (WMD 0.38 kg) and gait speed (WMD 0.12 m/s). On comparing exercise and nutrition, there was an improvement in gait speed (0.12 m/s) with exercise alone. On comparing exercise with a control group, only handgrip (WMD 1.74 kg) and gait speed (WMD 0.11 m/s) showed improvement, whereas in the nutrition versus the control group, only the handgrip (WMD 0.90 kg) improved. Although exercise and nutritional therapy together demonstrated improved muscle strength, exercise is recommended for the improvement of physical performance."

METHODS: In this 2-site cross-sectional study, MD patients were age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and gender-matched to controls. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Physical functioning was measured by handgrip strength, 6-minute walking test, 30-second sit-to-stand test (30SCT), and 6-minute mastication test. Total daily protein intake was calculated by 3-day food records. Malnutrition was assessed by Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment and the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria and sarcopenia by the 2018 consensus. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Fisher exact test, and Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Thirty-seven MD patients (42 ± 12 years, BMI: 23 ± 4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , 59% females) and 37 matched controls were included. Handgrip strength was moderate, inversely related to fat mass index in both MD patients and controls, whereas it correlated with fat-free mass index in controls solely. Protein intake was associated with muscle strength (handgrip strength and 30SCT) in MD patients but not in controls. Twenty-seven MD patients (73%) were malnourished, and 5 (14%) were classified as sarcopenic. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle strength is related to body composition and protein intake in MD patients. This, in combination with the high incidence of both malnutrition and sarcopenia, warrants individual nutrition assessment in MD patients."

METHODS: Data of 707 participants with sarcopenia aged > 60 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 were analyzed. Body composition, body mass index (BMI), physical function status, demographics, dietary intake (protein and vitamins A, C, E), lifestyle factors and comorbidities were measured, stratified by gender. RESULTS: Dietary levels of carbohydrate, fat and vitamin E differed significantly between genders (P < 0.05). Physical function limitations (48.5 vs. 36%; P < 0.001), basic activities of daily living (ADL) limitations (37 vs. 24.4%; P < 0.001), and instrumental ADL limitations (25.6 vs. 17.8%) were higher in women than in men. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, in males, intake of optimal amounts of vitamin C (Q3: ≥ 60.71 mg/day) was associated with basic ADL limitations. In females, protein intake of more than 1.11 g/kg/day was associated with both basic and instrumental ADL limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Only dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C and E, but not protein, was associated with physical functioning in older males with sarcopenia. In contrast, only intake of higher amounts of protein, but not vitamins, was associated with physical functioning in older females with sarcopenia."

Consequences of falling include death, injuries, fear of falling, and subsequent loss of independence. The age-related loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) as well as muscle strength are markers of the frailty syndrome. In addition, they are associated with physical function and are a risk factor for falling. Older adults should be screened for falls at least annually. If evaluated as at-risk, a comprehensive falls assessment should be conducted to determine an individual's risk profile. Physical exercise with balance and strength training play a key role in the prevention and management of functional decline and fall risk. Multifactorial interventions are indicated in at-risk individuals. In sarcopenic individuals, sufficient intake of protein must be taken into account and supplementation in combination with exercise appears to be useful."

            "abstract": "Sarcopenia is defined as an age-related decrease in muscle mass and performance. Several consensus definitions of sarcopenia exist, each providing different cut points and methodologies for assessing muscle mass and muscle strength. Thus, wide variation in the prevalence of sarcopenia has been reported, generally ranging up to 45% for men and 26% for women. Risk factors for sarcopenia include age, malnutrition, and physical inactivity. Additional evidence suggests a protective role for protein supplementation in older adults to preserve lean body mass and prevent frailty, accepted intervention targets for reducing the risk of sarcopenia. Protein supplements vary widely in their composition, and small trials of heterogeneous study designs have made it difficult to extrapolate findings to develop data-driven, evidence-based recommendations for protein supplementation in sarcopenia prevention. Short-term randomized controlled trials of muscle protein synthesis have demonstrated that whey protein increases synthesis more so than casein or soy isolates. Studies also suggest that essential amino acids stimulate muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than nonessential amino acids. This review summarizes the epidemiological and clinical trial evidence establishing the current definitions for sarcopenia and provides an overview of the state of the evidence for protein supplementation to prevent and/or mitigate sarcopenia."

As a modifiable risk factor, nutrition may represent a target for preventing or postponing the onset of these geriatric conditions. Among nutrients, high-quality protein, leucine, vitamin D, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (<i>n</i>-3 PUFA) are of particular interest for their demonstrated effects on skeletal muscle health. This narrative review aims to examine the recent observational and interventional evidence on the associations and the role of these nutrients in the muscle mass, strength, mobility, and physical function of free-living older adults, who are either healthy or at risk of frailty. Recent evidence supports a higher protein intake recommendation of 1.0⁻1.2 g/kg/day in healthy older adults; an evenly distributed mealtime protein intake or minimal protein per meal may be beneficial. In addition, vitamin D supplementation of 800⁻1000 IU, particularly when vitamin D status is low, and doses of ~3 g/day of <i>n</i>-3 PUFA may be favorable for physical function, muscle mass, and strength. Reviewed studies are highly heterogenous, yet the quantity, quality, and timing of intakes should be considered when designing intervention studies. Combined protein, leucine, vitamin D, and <i>n</i>-3 PUFA supplements may convey added benefits and may represent an intervention strategy in the prevention of sarcopenia and functional decline."

The prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia in older patients undergoing rehabilitation is 49-67 % and 40-46.5 %, respectively. Malnutrition and sarcopenia are associated with poorer rehabilitation outcome and physical function. Therefore, a combination of both rehabilitation and nutrition care management may improve outcome in disabled elderly with malnutrition and sarcopenia. The concept of rehabilitation nutrition as a combination of both rehabilitation and nutrition care management and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health guidelines are used to evaluate nutrition status and to maximize functionality in the elderly and other people with disability. Assessment of the multifactorial causes of primary and secondary sarcopenia is important because rehabilitation nutrition for sarcopenia differs depending on its etiology. Treatment of age-related sarcopenia should include resistance training and dietary supplements of amino acids. Therapy for activity-related sarcopenia includes reduced bed rest time and early mobilization and physical activity. Treatment for disease-related sarcopenia requires therapies for advanced organ failure, inflammatory disease, malignancy, or endocrine disease, while therapy for nutrition-related sarcopenia involves appropriate nutrition management to increase muscle mass. Because primary and secondary sarcopenia often coexist in people with disability, the concept of rehabilitation nutrition is useful for their treatment. Stroke, hip fracture, and hospital-associated deconditioning are major causes of disability, and inpatients of rehabilitation facilities often have malnutrition and sarcopenia. We review the concept of rehabilitation nutrition, the rehabilitation nutrition options for stroke, hip fracture, hospital-associated deconditioning, sarcopenic dysphagia, and then evaluate the amount of research interest in rehabilitation nutrition."

These diseases and unfavorable laboratory values, which are characteristic of this period in women, can be significantly improved by eliminating and reducing dietary risk factors. Changing dietary habits during perimenopause is most effectively achieved through nutrition counseling and intervention. To reduce the risk factors of all these diseases, and in the case of an already existing disease, dietary therapy led by a dietitian should be an integral part of the treatment. The following review summarizes the recommendations for a balanced diet and fluid intake, the dietary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the role of sleep, and the key preventive nutrients in menopause, such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin C, B vitamins, and protein intake. In summary, during the period of perimenopause and menopause, many lifestyle factors can reduce the risk of developing all the diseases (cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and tumors) and symptoms characteristic of this period."

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2020 estimated that 25% of participants had at least 1 CKM condition. It is proposed that CKM syndrome originates in excess and/or dysfunctional adipose tissue, which secretes proinflammatory and prooxidative products leading to damaged tissues in arteries, the heart, and the kidney, and reduction in insulin sensitivity. CKM syndrome is classified into 4 stages based on the presence of risk factors and clinical signs. Risk factors associated with progression of CKM syndrome include chronic inflammatory conditions, family history of diabetes or kidney disease, mental health and sleep disorders, increased levels of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and sex-specific risk enhancers. There are substantial racial and ethnic differences, although they are likely due to social determinants of health (SDOH). The American Heart Association suggests that CKM syndrome screening should include both biological factors and SDOH. Interventions in patients with stages 0 to 3 CKM syndrome focus on preventing future cardiovascular events by management of excess adiposity, mainly through diet and exercise in the early stages, then through pharmacological treatment of metabolic syndrome components in later stages. There is a general acceptance that treatment of CKM syndrome should involve a holistic approach to prevention, screening, and management to improve outcomes and reduce long-term morbidity and mortality."

What should people eat for the prevention, management and remission of type 2 diabetes? Recently, progress has been made in research evidence that has advanced our understanding in several areas of past uncertainty. This article examines some of these issues, focusing on the role of diet in weight management and in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. It considers nutritional strategies including low-energy, low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets, discusses inter-relationships between nutrients, foods and dietary patterns, and examines aspects of quantity and quality together with new developments, challenges and future directions."

Nutrition and policy science have advanced rapidly, creating confusion yet also providing powerful opportunities to reduce the adverse health and economic impacts of poor diets. This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non-genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases."

Although associations between diet, obesity and the related metabolic syndrome (MetS), stress, and mental disorders exist, causal pathways have not been established. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the relationship between diet, stress, obesity and psychiatric disorders related to stress. RESULTS: Diet and obesity can affect mood through direct effects, or stress-related mental disorders could lead to changes in diet habits that affect weight. Alternatively, common factors such as stress or predisposition could lead to both obesity and stress-related mental disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Specific aspects of diet can lead to acute changes in mood as well as stimulate inflammation, which has led to efforts to assess polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) as a treatment for depression. Bidirectional relationships between these different factors are also likely. Finally, there has been increased attention recently on the relationship between the gut and the brain, with the realization that the gut microbiome has an influence on brain function and probably also mood and behavior, introducing another way diet can influence mental health and disorders. Brain areas and neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that are involved in both mood and appetite likely play a role in mediating this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the relationship between diet, stress and mood and behavior could have important implications for the treatment of both stress-related mental disorders and obesity."

A balanced diet counterparts these extreme conditions with the proper proportion, composition, quantity, and presence of macronutrients, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds. However, little is known on the way these components exert any influence on our health. These nutrients aiming to feed our bodies, our tissues, and our cells, first need to reach mitochondria, where they are decomposed into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O to obtain energy. Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and mainly responsible for nutrients metabolism, but they are also the main source of oxidative stress and cell death by apoptosis. Unappropriated nutrients may support mitochondrial to become the Trojan horse in the cell. This review aims to provide an approach to the role that some nutrients exert on mitochondria as a major contributor to high prevalent Western conditions including metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of pathologic conditions which promotes type II diabetes and cardiovascular risk. Clinical and experimental data extracted from in vitro animal and cell models further demonstrated in patients, support the idea that a balanced diet, in a healthy lifestyle context, promotes proper bioenergetic and mitochondrial function, becoming the best medicine to prevent the onset and progression of MetS. Any advance in the prevention and management of these prevalent complications help to face these challenging global health problems, by ameliorating the quality of life of patients and reducing the associated sociosanitary burden."

Guidelines consistently suggest reducing energy intake to counteract the obesity epidemic, frequently resulting in sarcopenic obesity, a condition associated with poorer metabolic control and cardiovascular disease. Various dietary approaches have been proposed with largely similar results, with a preference for the Mediterranean diet and the best practice being the diet that patients feel confident of maintaining in the long term based on individual preferences. Patient adherence is indeed the pivotal factor for weight loss and long-term maintenance, requiring intensive lifestyle intervention. The consumption of nutritional supplements continues to increase even if international societies do not support their systematic use. Inositols and vitamin D supplementation, as well as micronutrients (zinc, chromium, magnesium) and pre/probiotics, result in modest improvement in insulin sensitivity, but their use is not systematically suggested. To reach the desired goals, patients should be actively involved in the collaborative development of a personalised meal plan associated with habitual physical activity, aiming at normal body weight and metabolic control."

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the discovery that amino acids (AA) are not only cell signaling molecules but are also regulators of gene expression and the protein phosphorylation cascade. Additionally, AA are key precursors for syntheses of hormones and low-molecular weight nitrogenous substances with each having enormous biological importance. Physiological concentrations of AA and their metabolites (e.g., nitric oxide, polyamines, glutathione, taurine, thyroid hormones, and serotonin) are required for the functions. However, elevated levels of AA and their products (e.g., ammonia, homocysteine, and asymmetric dimethylarginine) are pathogenic factors for neurological disorders, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, an optimal balance among AA in the diet and circulation is crucial for whole body homeostasis. There is growing recognition that besides their role as building blocks of proteins and polypeptides, some AA regulate key metabolic pathways that are necessary for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and immunity. They are called functional AA, which include arginine, cysteine, glutamine, leucine, proline, and tryptophan. Dietary supplementation with one or a mixture of these AA may be beneficial for (1) ameliorating health problems at various stages of the life cycle (e.g., fetal growth restriction, neonatal morbidity and mortality, weaning-associated intestinal dysfunction and wasting syndrome, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and infertility); (2) optimizing efficiency of metabolic transformations to enhance muscle growth, milk production, egg and meat quality and athletic performance, while preventing excess fat deposition and reducing adiposity. Thus, AA have important functions in both nutrition and health."

Diabetes, frailty, and cognitive dysfunction are closely related to the mechanisms of aging. Insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be common mechanisms shared by frailty and cognitive impairment. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, obesity, vascular factors, physical inactivity, and malnutrition are important risk factors for cognitive impairment and frailty in older adults with diabetes. The impact of nutrients on health outcomes varies with age; thus, shifting diet therapy strategies from the treatment of obesity/metabolic syndrome to frailty prevention may be necessary in patients with diabetes who are over 75 years of age, have frailty or sarcopenia, and experience malnutrition. For the prevention of frailty, optimal energy intake, sufficient protein and vitamin intake, and healthy dietary patterns should be recommended. The treatment of diabetes after middle age should include the awareness of proper glycemic control aimed at extending healthy life expectancy with proper nutrition, exercise, and social connectivity. Nutritional therapy in combination with exercise, optimal glycemic and metabolic control, and social participation/support for frailty prevention can extend healthy life expectancy and maintain quality of life in older adults with diabetes mellitus."

The majority of present non-communicable chronic diseases are attributed to civilization, an abundance of food, and a lack of physical activity. According to the purported lifestyles of early humans, the paleolithic diet (PD) encourages the intake of wild animal and plant foods. In recent decades, the paleolithic diet has grown in popularity, particularly among younger populations and those with cardiometabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases. Due to the nutrition profile of the paleolithic diet, historical studies have postulated that hunter-gatherers (HGs) have slender physiques and were physically fit and devoid of chronic ailments such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This review highlights the composition/constituent of the paleolithic diet along with an emphasis on current studies and evidence on the effectiveness of the paleolithic diet in mitigating chronic diseases."

Currently, this health condition has gained a momentum globally while raising concerns among health-related communities. The World Health Organization, American Heart Association and International Diabetes Federation have formulated diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. Diet and nutrition can influence this syndrome: for example, the Western diet is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, whereas the Nordic and Mediterranean diets and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension are potentially beneficial. The Mediterranean diet can affect the components of metabolic syndrome due to its high dietary fiber, omega 3 and 9 fatty acids, complex carbohydrates, antioxidants, minerals, vitamins and bioactive substances, such as polyphenols. These nutrients and bioactive substances can combat obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The mechanisms by which they do so are generally related to oxidative stress, inflammation (the most common risk factors for metabolic syndrome) and gastrointestinal function. The literature also shows examples of positive effects of the Mediterranean diet on the metabolic syndrome. In this review of the literature, we shed light on the effects, mechanisms and dynamic relationship between the Mediterranean diet and metabolic syndrome."

DESIGN: A systematic review of all meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the Mediterranean diet with a control diet on the treatment of type 2 diabetes and prediabetic states was conducted. Electronic searches were carried out up to January 2015. Trials were included for meta-analyses if they had a control group treated with another diet, if they were of sufficient duration (at least 6 months), and if they had at least 30 participants in each arm. A random-effect model was used to pool data. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Dietary patterns that described themselves as using a 'Mediterranean' dietary pattern. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes were glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and remission from the metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: From 2824 studies, 8 meta-analyses and 5 RCTs were eligible. A 'de novo' meta-analysis of 3 long-term (>6 months) RCTs of the Mediterranean diet and glycaemic control of diabetes favoured the Mediterranean diet as compared with lower fat diets. Another 'de novo' meta-analysis of two long-term RCTs showed a 49% increased probability of remission from the metabolic syndrome. 5 meta-analyses showed a favourable effect of the Mediterranean diet, as compared with other diets, on body weight, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 2 meta-analyses demonstrated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of future diabetes by 19-23%. CONCLUSIONS: The Mediterranean diet was associated with better glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors than control diets, including a lower fat diet, suggesting that it is suitable for the overall management of type 2 diabetes."

These approaches have benefits that include prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These dietary patterns are supported by strong evidence that promotes a primary focus on unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. Added sugars should be limited to less than 5% to 10% of daily caloric intake. Vegetables (not including potatoes) and fruits should make up one-half of each meal. Carbohydrate sources should primarily include beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. An emphasis on monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocados, and nuts, and omega-3 fatty acids, such as flax, cold-water fish, and nuts, helps prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women can spend up to 40% of their lives in the postmenopausal state. As women begin to transition into menopause, known as perimenopause, changes in hormonal concentrations and body composition dramatically increase overall cardiometabolic risk. Dietary patterns and interventions can be utilized to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) and some dietary patterns over others may be more beneficial due to their specific effects on the health aspects of menopause. In this narrative review, we summarize key cardiovascular alterations that occur during the menopause transition and explore current dietary recommendations to address CVD risk as well as explore the new frontier of precision nutrition and the implications for nutrition prescription during menopause. SUMMARY: Popular dietary interventions for CVD such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet (MED) have limited data in women following menopause. However, both diets improve CVD risk biomarkers of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as lower oxidative stress and inflammation and improve endothelial function. As the menopause transition increases the risk for developing metabolic syndrome, insulin insensitivity, and dyslipidemia, the DASH diet and MED may be impactful dietary strategies for mediating CVD risk in menopausal women. However, these are \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches that neglect individual characteristics such as genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Precision nutrition considers individual factors for nutrition prescription, spanning from evaluating food intake preferences and behaviors to deep phenotyping. Data from a large-scale investigation of the menopause transition suggests nutritional strategies that address postprandial glycemic responses, and the gut microbiome may attenuate some of the unfavorable effects of menopause on CVD risk factors. KEY MESSAGES: Considering menopause, women are a clinical population that would greatly benefit from precision nutrition. Future research should explore the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a precision nutrition framework to modify the DASH diet and MED to address adverse effects that occur during the menopause transition are vital for supporting women's health as they age."

RECENT FINDINGS: The global burden of gout is rising worldwide, particularly in developed nations as well as in women. Patients with gout are often recommended to follow a low-purine (i.e., low-protein) diet to avoid purine-loading. However, such an approach may lead to increased consumption of unhealthy carbohydrates and fats, which in turn contributes to metabolic syndrome and subsequently raises serum urate levels and leads to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. On the other hand, several well-established diets for cardiometabolic health, such as the Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, in combination with weight loss for those who are overweight or obese, also have beneficial effects on relevant gout endpoints. It is important to recognize not only the direct effect of diet on hyperuricemia and gout, but its mediated effect through obesity and insulin resistance. Thus, several preeminent healthy dietary patterns that have proven benefits in cardiometabolic health have the power to holistically address not only gout morbidity but also its associated comorbidities that lead to premature mortality among patients with gout."

            "abstract": "For many years, the dogma has been that insulin resistance precedes the development of hyperinsulinemia. However, recent data suggest a reverse order and place hyperinsulinemia mechanistically upstream of insulin resistance. Genetic background, consumption of the \"modern\" Western diet and over-nutrition may increase insulin secretion, decrease insulin pulses and/or reduce hepatic insulin clearance, thereby causing hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia disturbs the balance of the insulin-GH-IGF axis and shifts the insulin : GH ratio towards insulin and away from GH. This insulin-GH shift promotes energy storage and lipid synthesis and hinders lipid breakdown, resulting in obesity due to higher fat accumulation and lower energy expenditure. Hyperinsulinemia is an important etiological factor in the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature mortality. It has been further hypothesized that nutritionally driven insulin exposure controls the rate of mammalian aging. Interventions that normalize/reduce plasma insulin concentrations might play a key role in the prevention and treatment of age-related decline, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Caloric restriction, increasing hepatic insulin clearance and maximizing insulin sensitivity are at present the three main strategies available for managing hyperinsulinemia. This may slow down age-related physiological decline and prevent age-related diseases. Drugs that reduce insulin (hyper) secretion, normalize pulsatile insulin secretion and/or increase hepatic insulin clearance may also have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of hyperinsulinemia-mediated diseases. Future research should focus on new strategies to minimize hyperinsulinemia at an early stage, aiming at successfully preventing and treating hyperinsulinemia-mediated diseases."

NAFLD is a significant public health concern worldwide, impacting individuals of all ages, and its prevalence is projected to increase in the near future due to its connection with obesity. Intrinsic (genetics) and external (lifestyle) factors may also modulate NAFLD, and, in turn, may partly explain the observed relationship between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although many drugs are been tested to treat NAFLD, to date, no drug has indication to specifically treat this disorder. Thus, the current management of NAFLD relies on lifestyle modifications and specifically on weight loss, physical activity, and the intake of a healthy diet. In the present narrative review, we will discuss the effects of certain dietary patterns on NAFLD incidence and progression."

The relationship between alterations in intestinal microbiota and diseases associated with civilization is well documented. GM dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders. Multiple factors modulate the composition of the microbiota and how it physically functions, but one of the major factors triggering GM establishment is diet. In this paper, we reviewed the current knowledge about the relationship between nutrition, gut microbiota, and host metabolic status. We described how macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fat) and different dietary patterns (e.g., Western-style diet, vegetarian diet, Mediterranean diet) interact with the composition and activity of GM, and how gut bacterial dysbiosis has an influence on metabolic disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia."

METHODS: This study included 8183 eligible nonpregnant participants aged ≥20 years from the NHANES 2011-18. MetS was defined as the presence of at least three of the following components: central obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting blood glucose. The prevalence of MetS was estimated taking into account the complex sampling. The time trend was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: The total prevalence of MetS increased from 37.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 34.0%-41.4%] in 2011-12 to 41.8% (95% CI: 38.1%-45.7%) in 2017-18 (P for trend = .028). Among the MetS components, the prevalence of elevated glucose increased from 48.9% (95% CI: 45.7%-52.5%) in 2011-12 to 64.7% (95% CI: 61.4%-67.9%) in 2017-18 (P for trend <.001). The prevalence of MetS in participants with low educational attainment increased from 44.4% (95% CI: 38.8%-50.1%) in 2011-12 to 55.0% (95% CI: 50.8%-59.1%) in 2017-18 (P for trend = .01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MetS increased during 2011-18, notably in participants with low educational attainment. Lifestyle modification is needed to prevent MetS and the associated risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Key messages What is already known on this topic: Prevalence of metabolic syndrome is an index of the cardiometabolic health of a population. What this study adds: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in US adults increased during 2011-18, notably in participants with low educational attainment. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy: Lifestyle modification is needed to prevent metabolic syndrome and the associated risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

Within the PREDIMED trial, significant associations between diet-related metabolites and cardiovascular disease were identified, which were subsequently replicated in independent cohorts. Some notable metabolites identified include plasma levels of ceramides, acyl-carnitines, branched-chain amino acids, tryptophan, urea cycle pathways, and the lipidome. These metabolites and their related pathways have been associated with incidence of both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Future directions in precision nutrition research include: a) developing more robust multimetabolomic scores to predict long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality; b) incorporating more diverse populations and a broader range of dietary patterns; and c) conducting more translational research to bridge the gap between precision nutrition studies and clinical applications."

With the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome, effective dietary interventions are essential in reducing these health risks. The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil and moderate in fish and poultry, has shown promise in addressing metabolic syndrome and its associated components. This diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, primarily due to its unsaturated fats, polyphenols, and fiber, have improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and insulin sensitivity. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been linked to reductions in central obesity and insulin resistance, both key elements in managing metabolic syndrome. Regarding lipid management, the Mediterranean diet lowers triglyceride levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, enhancing lipid profiles. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels, reducing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the diet promotes weight loss and improves body composition, particularly by decreasing visceral fat, a primary driver of metabolic syndrome according to IDF classification. The Mediterranean diet offers a holistic approach to managing metabolic syndrome and reducing the risk of related chronic diseases. Its positive impact on metabolic health, combined with lifestyle changes like increased physical activity, provides a sustainable method for addressing the global burden of this syndrome. This review aimed to summarize the positive effects of the Mediterranean diet on the component of the metabolic syndrome with subsequent positive effects on cardiometabolic risk profile."

Simultaneously, studies have demonstrated the ability of parasites to alter microbial communities within their shared niche, leading to alterations in inflammatory processes. However, very few reports have addressed how these changes to the microbiome may be a mechanism by which parasites influence not only inflammation but also metabolic states. In this review, we attempt to draw parallels between the three capacious topics and examine the interrelationship between them."

In recent years, scientific focus on this topic has been growing up, in particular regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters and diabetes. In addition, studies on the remaining components showed discordant results, which was likely due to heterogeneous and large celiac disease populations and to the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, knowledge about the role of the GFD on inflammatory cytokines and the relationship among vitamin D and celiac disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and GFD is needed. In this narrative review, we provided evidence regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure and inflammatory cascade, also evaluating the role of vitamin D, trying to summarize whether this nutritional pattern may be a value-added for subjects with dysmetabolic conditions. Finally, due to the limited findings and very low-certainty evidence, predominantly based on observational studies, the real effects of a GFD on different components of MS, however, are unclear; nevertheless, an improvement in HDL levels has been reported, although data on glycemic levels are discordant."

The current research on precision nutrition is heavily focused on genome and gut microbiome, while epigenome (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and histone modification) is largely neglected. The epigenome acts as the interface between the human genome and environmental stressors, including diets and lifestyle. Increasing evidence has suggested that epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may determine the individual variability in metabolic health and response to dietary and lifestyle factors and, therefore, hold great promise in discovering novel markers for precision nutrition and potential targets for precision interventions. This review summarized recent studies on DNA methylation with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, with more emphasis put in the relations of DNA methylation with nutrition and diet/lifestyle interventions. We also briefly reviewed other epigenetic events, such as non-coding RNAs, in relation to human health and nutrition, and discussed the potential role of epigenetics in the precision nutrition research."

            "abstract": "Poor nutrition is the leading cause of poor health, health care spending, and lost productivity in the United States and globally, which acts through cardiometabolic diseases as precursors to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. There is great interest in how the social determinants of health (the conditions in which people are born, live, work, develop, and age) impact cardiometabolic disease. Food insecurity is an example of a powerful social determinant of health that impacts health outcomes. Nutrition insecurity, a distinct but related concept to food insecurity, is a direct determinant of health. In this article, we provide an overview of how diet in early life relates to cardiometabolic disease and then continue to focus on the concepts of food insecurity and nutrition insecurity. In the discussions herein we make important distinctions between the concepts of food insecurity and nutrition insecurity and provide a review of their concepts, histories, measurement and assessment devices, trends and prevalence, and links to health and health disparities. The discussions here set the stage for future research and practice to directly address the negative consequences of food and nutrition insecurity."

MetS has become one of the most studied conditions, nevertheless, due to its complex etiology, this has not been fully elucidated. Recent evidence describes that both genetic and environmental factors play an important role on its development. With the advent of genomic-wide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have gained special importance. In this review, we present an update of the genetics surrounding MetS as a single entity as well as its corresponding risk factors, considering SNPs and gene-diet interactions related to cardiometabolic markers. In this study, we focus on the conceptual aspects, diagnostic criteria, as well as the role of genetics, particularly on SNPs and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for interindividual analysis. In addition, this review highlights future perspectives of personalized nutrition with regard to the approach of MetS and how individualized multiomics approaches could improve the current outlook."

METHODS: An electronic research in Medline (Pubmed) and Scopus was conducted. RESULTS: MetS and cognitive decline share common cardiometabolic pathways as MetS components can trigger cognitive impairment. On the other side, the risk factors for both MetS and cognitive impairment can be reduced by optimizing the nutritional intake. Clinical manifestations such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and increased central body adiposity are nutrition-related risk factors present during the prodromal period before cognitive impairment. The Mediterranean dietary pattern stands among the most discussed predominantly plant-based diets in relation to cardiometabolic disorders that may prevent dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other cognition-related disorders. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the consumption of specific dietary food groups as a part of the overall diet can improve cognitive outcomes, maybe due to their involvement in cardiometabolic paths. CONCLUSIONS: Early MetS detection may be helpful to prevent or delay cognitive decline. Moreover, this review highlights the importance of healthy nutritional habits to reverse such conditions and the urgency of early lifestyle interventions."

Nutrition plays a central role in CVD risk by affecting aging, adiposity, glycemia, blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation, and other risk factors and can affect CVD risk not only based on calorie intake and dietary composition but also the timing and range of meals. This review evaluates the effects of fasting, fasting-mimicking diets, and time-restricted eating on the reduction of CVD risk factors and provides initial data on their potential to serve as CVD prevention and treatment therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Intermittent fasting (IF), time-restricted eating (TRE), prolonged fasting (PF), and fasting-mimicking diets (FMD) show promise in the reduction of CVD risk factors. Results on IF, TRE, PF, and FMD on CVD risk factors are significant and often independent of weight loss, yet long-term studies on their effect on CVD are still lacking. Coupling periodic and prolonged, or intermittent and more frequent cycles of fasting or fasting-mimicking diets, designed to maximize compliance and minimize side effects, has the potential to play a central role in the prevention and treatment of CVD and metabolic syndrome."

Evidence from large cohort studies and clinical trials underscores the impact of diabetes and obesity as major risk factors for CVD, causing systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and neurohormonal activation. Frequently, a sedentary lifestyle and unbalanced dietary habits are associated with these risk factors. Physical activity and exercise training interventions, a Mediterranean and plant-based diet, smoking cessation, and reduction of alcohol have shown promise in mitigating these risks. The implementation of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy have emerged as new pillars of preventive medicine. This review discusses the evidence of lifestyle interventions to reduce the burden of diabetes, obesity, and CVD. It is highlighted that only a multifaceted, sustained approach integrating lifestyle interventions and pharmacological strategies can reduce the burden of disease and improve long-term outcomes."

Oxidative stress may impair normal physiological functions, leading to various illnesses. T2DM is considered to be associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which may play a significant role in the development of cardiovascular complications, cancer and vision loss through cataracts and retinopathy. While conventional therapies are a cornerstone for the management of the major risk factors of metabolic syndrome, increasing antioxidant defense by increasing intake of antioxidant-rich foods may improve long term prospects in CVD, obesity and T2DM. Bilberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> <i>myrtillus</i> <i>L.</i>) is one of the richest natural sources of anthocyanins which give berries their red/purple/blue coloration. Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants and are reported to play an important role in the prevention of metabolic disease and CVD as well as cancer and other conditions. This review focuses on the potential effects of bilberry supplementation on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. Although there is evidence to support the use of bilberry supplementation as part of a healthy diet, the potential benefits from the use of bilberry supplementation in patients with T2DM or CVD needs to be clarified in large clinical trials."

This diet not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also offers significant health benefits, including prevention and management of abdominal obesity, carbohydrate metabolism disorders, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure. These metabolic disorders are components of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. <b>Objectives:</b> This narrative review aims to gather the most recent findings on the impact of the planetary diet on individual components of metabolic syndrome and on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. <b>Methods:</b> The available research on the topic was identified via searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. <b>Results:</b> Abdominal obesity, a major risk factor for a range of chronic diseases, can be effectively mitigated by adhering to plant-based dietary patterns, which have been shown to reduce waist circumference and improve overall cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, the planetary diet plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of type-2 diabetes and improving glycemic control, with specific dietary components such as whole grains and fiber, demonstrating positive effects on blood glucose levels. This diet is additionally associated with favorable lipid profiles, including lower levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, which are critical in the prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. <b>Conclusions:</b> These multiple benefits highlight that the planetary diet may be an effective strategy for managing and preventing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. However, further research is needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and applicability across diverse populations."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of dietary interventions in volunteers with metabolic syndrome as well as studies examining the impact of dietary fat on the separate components of metabolic syndrome was undertaken using only recent meta-analyses, if available. RESULTS: Most of the data suggest that replacing carbohydrates with any fat, but particularly polyunsaturated fat, will lower triglyceride(TG), increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, but have no effects on fasting glucose in normal volunteers or insulin sensitivity, as assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps. Fasting insulin may be lowered by fat. Monounsaturated fat (MUFA) is preferable to polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) for fasting insulin and glucose lowering. The addition of 3-4 g of N3 fats will lower TG and blood pressure (BP) and reduce the proportion of subjects with metabolic syndrome. Dairy fat (50% saturated fat) is also related to a lower incidence of metabolic syndrome in cohort studies."

The components are abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Prediabetes, which is a combination of excess body fat and insulin resistance, is considered an underlying etiology of metabolic syndrome. Prediabetes manifests as impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. Impaired fasting glucose is defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance requires a blood glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g oral intake of glucose. In patients with prediabetes, the rate of progression to diabetes within 3 years can be decreased by approximately 58% with lifestyle modifications. These include weight loss through exercise (30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week) and dietary modifications. Recommended diets are high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. Consumption of sweetened beverages, including diet soda, should be avoided. For patients who do not achieve goals with lifestyle modifications, metformin can be considered. Weight loss drugs and bariatric surgery are appropriate for select patients. Hypertension and dyslipidemia should be managed according to current guidelines."

The aim of this review is to summarize the data related to the influence of the gut microbiota on the development of obesity and the MetS, highlighting the role of diet in controlling the MetS by modifying the gut microbiota. The main alterations in the gut microbiota of individuals with MetS consist of an increased Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio and a reduced capacity to degrade carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, which in turn is related with the metabolic dysfunction of the host organism rather than with obesity itself. In addition to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, with its high fiber intake, a diet with 30% fat content but with a high content in fruit and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, is beneficial and partially restores the dysbiosis found in individuals with MetS. Overall, the shaping of the gut microbiota through the administration of prebiotics or probiotics increases the short-chain fatty acid production and is therefore a valid alternative in MetS treatment."

Dietary behavior is a modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Furthermore, the fact that cardiovascular events and stress-related emotional disorders share a common epidemiology may indicate the existence of pathways linking these two diseases (Chauvet-Gelinier and Bonin, 2017). Psychosocial stress can lead to changes in dietary patterns (DP) and under chronic stress conditions, high caloric and hyperpalatable foods are preferred. The interplay between these two factors impacts on several biological pathways: for example, it can prime the hippocampus to produce a potentiated neuroinflammatory response, generating memory deficits; it can also affect gut microbiota composition, ultimately influencing behavior and brain health and creating a predisposition to the development of diseases such as obesity, CVD, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Though both cognition and emotion can be heavily affected by caloric intake, diet composition and stress, the molecular pathways involved remain elusive (Spencer et al., 2017). In this review, we describe the interplay between stress and DP at a molecular level, and how these factors relate to brain health and mental fitness. Finally, we show how these findings could give rise to novel therapeutic targets for chronic diseases."

Persistent inflammation is common to both diseases. They share increased inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-6. Biologics have revolutionized the treatment of plaque psoriasis and also have a positive impact on metabolic syndrome. There is some evidence that TNFα inhibitors decrease insulin resistance and improve glycemic indices. Some psoriasis treatments may result in decreased body weight. Lifestyle measures used in the management of metabolic syndrome, such as weight loss, exercise, and healthy diet, are beneficial in patients with psoriasis. Considering the association between metabolic syndrome and psoriasis, we recommend screening patients with psoriasis for metabolic syndrome with clinical examinations and laboratory tests. Patients with a co-diagnosis of these diseases deserve special attention for optimal treatment."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its individual components among Jordanian patients with T2DM. A cross-sectional design was conducted among T2DM patients at the National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics in Jordan. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and clinical data extracted from medical records. The National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) diagnostic criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome. Among 1017 participants aged between 22 and 90 years, the overall prevalence of IDF defined metabolic syndrome was 84.2% (72.5% and 96.2% among males and females, respectively). Using ATP III criteria, overall prevalence was 79.1% (77.4% and 80.8% among males and females, respectively). Advancing age, female gender, nonadherence to a diet regimen, sedentary lifestyle or insufficient physical activity, and duration of diabetes ≥10 years were significantly associated with increased odds of metabolic syndrome, regardless of the definition used. Current smoking status and family history of cardiovascular diseases were significantly associated with increased likelihood of ATP III defined metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among Jordanian patients with T2DM is extremely high. The main modifiable risk factors of metabolic syndrome among these patients include nonadherence to a diet regimen, insufficient physical activity, being overweight/obese and smoking. It is recommended that healthcare providers counsel patients on the importance of maintaining physical activity, smoking cessation, and adherence to a diet regimen."

In addition, the Mediterranean diet is not based on restriction of nutrients but does limit intake of processed foods. Prospective studies have confirmed that the Mediterranean diet confers primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population. The benefits of the Mediterranean diet lifestyle include reducing the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and lowers blood pressure. In adults with CKD, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of CKD progression and its complications such as hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis, and reduces production of uremic toxins and inflammatory mediators when compared to omnivore dietary patterns. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to confirm the cardiovascular disease prevention with the Mediterranean diet in adults with CKD. Medical nutrition therapy remains a cornerstone of CKD management, and the Mediterranean diet could be utilized to slow CKD progression and complications."

These behavioral factors, on a predisposing genetic background, trigger changes in gut microbiota, inflammation, dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, leading to metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity as well as atherosclerosis. Treatment options to counteract both the progression and development of CVD and NAFLD include lifestyle interventions, optimal medical therapy of comorbid conditions and, as final possibility, bariatric surgery. As no causal pharmacotherapy of NAFLD is available, further research is urgently needed to address the unmet need of a growing population with NAFLD and CVD."

There is mounting evidence that arterial stiffness in obesity is an independent and strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cognitive functional decline, and chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular stiffness is a precursor to atherosclerosis, systolic hypertension, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, and impairment of coronary and cerebral flow. Moreover, premenopausal women lose the CVD protection normally afforded to them in the setting of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, and this loss of CVD protection is inextricably linked to an increased propensity for arterial stiffness. Stiffness of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix remodeling, perivascular adipose tissue inflammation, and immune cell dysfunction contribute to the development of arterial stiffness in obesity. Enhanced endothelial cortical stiffness decreases endothelial generation of nitric oxide, and increased oxidative stress promotes destruction of nitric oxide. Our research over the past 5 years has underscored an important role of increased aldosterone and vascular mineralocorticoid receptor activation in driving development of cardiovascular stiffness, especially in females consuming a Western diet. In this review the cellular mechanisms of obesity-associated arterial stiffness are highlighted."

The relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been explored in cross-sectional studies with discordant results. Two prospective studies with a follow up of 6 and 7.5 years show that subjects with the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had lower cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome than those with the lowest adherence. Two interventional trials document a positive effect of a Mediterranean diet on reversal of metabolic syndrome. The Mediterranean diet may be also useful to ameliorate liver function tests in obese patients with insulin resistance and diabetes. There is no consensus as to what diet is the optimal one for patients who have the metabolic syndrome. A Mediterranean diet that is moderately lower in carbohydrate (45%), and moderately higher in fat (35-40%), with less than 10% of saturated fat, may be beneficial for ameliorating features of the metabolic syndrome, including effects on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and liver function."

The MS is defined as increased abdominal obesity in concert with elevated fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and plasma lipids. It is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and for cardiovascular complications and mortality. Here, we review work demonstrating that various aspects of coagulation and hemostasis, as well as vascular reactivity and function, become impaired progressively during chronic ingestion of a western diet, but also acutely after meals. We outline that both T2DM and cardiovascular disease should be viewed as inflammatory diseases and describe that chronic overload of free fatty acids and glucose can trigger inflammatory pathways directly or via increased production of ROS. We propose that since endothelial stress and increases in platelet activity precede inflammation and overt symptoms of the MS, they are likely the first hit. This suggests that endothelial activation and insulin resistance are probably causative in the observed chronic low-level metabolic inflammation, and thus both metabolic and cardiovascular complications linked to consumption of a western diet."

The synergy of both is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Hence, the present study aims to unveil clusters at high risk of metabolic syndrome and ascertain cluster characteristics based on dietary patterns among adolescents aged 10-19 years. DATA AND METHODS: The study utilizes secondary data, i.e., Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey conducted in 2016-18. The study sample includes children and adolescents aged 10-19 years. An unsupervised learning algorithm was used to ascertain possible clusters in the data based on individuals' dietary patterns. The k-means were used to cluster the data according to their dietary patterns. To determine the number of clusters elbow method was used, and appropriate validation indices were also obtained for the final k. Further, to ascertain the distribution of the obesogenic dietary patterns and metabolic conditions in each cluster was analysed. Bivariate descriptive analysis was used to draw further inferences. RESULTS: The k-means clusters identified five optimum clusters based on 12,318 adolescents (6333 males (mean age:14.2 ± 2.8) and 5985 females (mean age:14.3 ± 2.8)) 17 dietary patterns. Clusters were named based on how prudent these were in terms of consuming a healthy diet. Cluster phenotypic characteristics were defined as follows: a cluster of obesogenic diets (24%) constituted the highest proportion of the total sample and was significantly suffering from obesity (p < 0.001), and greater proportions of lipid anomalies (p = 0.51) and hypertension (p = 0.44) but not statistically significant. In contrast, 21% of the sample comprised a plant-based diet cluster and suffered from all deficiencies but folate (p = 0.625), zinc (p = 0.132), and greater proportion from obesity (p = 0.19; not significant), and diabetes (p < 0.001). A cluster of \"convenient\" (20%) mainly suffered from lipid anomalies (p = 0.00), diabetes (p = 0.03), and a greater proportion from hypertension (p = 0.56) with deficiencies of all the essential vitamins and minerals but significantly from vitamin A (p < 0.001), folate (p < 0.001), and iron (p = 0.017). Lastly, the cluster of those who follow a \"Western diet\" (17%) was found to have lipid anomalies (p = 0.003), diabetes (p = 0.016), greater proportion of vitamin B12 (p = 0.136), D (p = 0.002), folate (p < 0.001), and iron deficiencies (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescents in India show a strong association between obesogenic diet and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the burden of metabolic syndrome at early ages can be prevented by controlling obesogenic dietary practices and addressing micronutrient deficiencies. This may be done by targeted health promotional campaigns in schools and college-going populations in India."

Little is known about its acceptance and relationship to cardiovascular risk markers in US adolescents. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, years 2007-2014, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of adherence to the Mediterranean diet among a representative sample of US adolescents (<i>n</i> = 4223), factors that influence adherence, and whether adherence is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors including metabolic syndrome. MD adherence was calculated using the KIDMED scoring system. We found that overall MD adherence was very low among US adolescents, with Mexican American youths having higher adherence compared to other groups. Higher income was associated with greater adherence. There was low intake of key MD foods including olive oil and finfish. The unadjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 6.6%. MD adherence was not associated with metabolic syndrome."

The clinical characteristics of the metabolic syndrome include insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abdominal obesity and hypertension. The diverse clinical characteristics illustrate the complexity of the disease process, which involves several dysregulated metabolic pathways. Thus, multiple genetic targets must be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of the metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, the human genome has not changed markedly in the last decade but the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has increased exponentially, which illustrates the importance of gene-environmental interactions. There is good evidence that nutrition plays an important role in the development and progression of the metabolic syndrome. Indeed, obesity is a key aetiological factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Understanding the biological impact of gene-nutrient interactions will provide a key insight into the pathogenesis and progression of diet-related polygenic disorders, including the metabolic syndrome. The present paper will explore the interactions between genetic background and dietary exposure or nutritional therapy, focusing on the role of dietary fatty acids within the context of nutrient regulation of gene expression and individual responsiveness to dietary therapy. Only with a full understanding of gene-gene, gene-nutrient and gene-nutrient-environment interactions can the molecular basis of the metabolic syndrome be solved to minimise the adverse health effects of obesity and reduce the risk of the metabolic syndrome, and subsequent T2DM and CVD."

Occurrence of both metabolic syndrome and diabetes and their vascular complications share several pathogenetic features including subclinical, low-grade inflammation, altered oxidative/antioxidant status, and persistent platelet activation. Despite the availability of multiple interventions to counteract these metabolic changes, including appropriate diet, regular exercise, weight control and drugs, epidemiological data are witnessing the growing trend of the problem, reflecting both the multifactorial nature of these diseases as well as the scarce compliance of patients to established strategies. Several nutraceuticals used in clinical practice have been shown to target the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and their complications and to favorably modulate a number of biochemical and clinical endpoints. These compounds include antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, flavonoids, vitamin D, conjugated linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals such as chromium and magnesium, alpha-lipoic acid, phytoestrogens, and dietary fibers. Several areas of concern exist regarding the use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in this setting, including product standardization, definition of optimal dosing regimen, potential side effects, drug interactions, and need for evidence-based indications."

Proper nutrition provides the energy to perform everyday activities, prevents infection, builds muscle, and helps to prevent kidney disease from getting worse. However, what does a proper diet mean for a CKD patient? Nutrition requirements differ depending on the level of kidney function and the presence of co-morbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The diet of CKD patients should help to slow the rate of progression of kidney failure, reduce uremic toxicity, decrease proteinuria, maintain good nutritional status, and lower the risk of kidney disease-related secondary complications (cardiovascular disease, bone disease, and hypertension). It has been suggested that plant proteins may exert beneficial effects on blood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate, as well as results in milder renal tissue damage when compared to animal proteins. The National Kidney Foundation recommends vegetarianism, or part-time vegetarian diet as being beneficial to CKD patients. Their recommendations are supported by the results of studies demonstrating that a plant-based diet may hamper the development or progression of some complications of chronic kidney disease, such as heart disease, protein loss in urine, and the progression of kidney damage. However, there are sparse reports suggesting that a vegan diet is not appropriate for CKD patients and those undergoing dialysis due to the difficulty in consuming enough protein and in maintaining proper potassium and phosphorus levels. Therefore, this review will focus on the problem as to whether vegetarian diet and its modifications are suitable for chronic kidney disease patients."

            "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is a condition characterized by a special constellation of reversible major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The main, diagnostic, components are reduced HDL-cholesterol, raised triglycerides, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose, all of which are related to weight gain, specifically intra-abdominal/ectopic fat accumulation and a large waist circumference. Using internationally adopted arbitrary cut-off values for waist circumference, having metabolic syndrome doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease, but offers an effective treatment approach through weight management. Metabolic syndrome now affects 30-40% of people by age 65, driven mainly by adult weight gain, and by a genetic or epigenetic predisposition to intra-abdominal/ectopic fat accumulation related to poor intra-uterine growth. Metabolic syndrome is also promoted by a lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue, low skeletal muscle mass and anti-retroviral drugs. Reducing weight by 5-10%, by diet and exercise, with or without, anti-obesity drugs, substantially lowers all metabolic syndrome components, and risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as smoking should be corrected as a priority. Anti-diabetic agents which improve insulin resistance and reduce blood pressure, lipids and weight should be preferred for diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome. Bariatric surgery offers an alternative treatment for those with BMI ≥ 40 or 35-40 kg/m(2) with other significant co-morbidity. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease is expected to rise along with the global obesity epidemic: greater emphasis should be given to effective early weight-management to reduce risk in pre-symptomatic individuals with large waists."

This is due to the development of effective chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation, combined with an optimized stratification of therapy and better supportive care regimens. As a consequence, active surveillance strategies of late sequelae have been developed to improve the quality of survival. Several epidemiological studies have reported an increased incidence of (components of) metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) after cranial radiotherapy (CRT) has been previously described as an important cause of MetS. New insights suggest a role for abdominal radiotherapy as a determinant for MetS as well. The role of other risk factors, such as specific chemotherapeutic agents, steroids, gonadal impairment, thyroid morbidity and genetics, warrants further investigation. This knowledge is important to define subgroups of CCS that are at risk to develop (subclinical) MetS features. These survivors might benefit from standard surveillance and early interventions, for example lifestyle and diet advice and medical treatment, thereby preventing the development of cardiovascular disease."

Metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors, is associated with the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Epidemiological studies have documented that nutritional factors may affect the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. Beyond weight control and reduction of total calories, the diet should be low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and simple sugars. In addition, there should be ample intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and monounsaturated fat; fish intake should be encouraged. These features are very reminiscent of the nutritional principles currently used to define the Mediterranean-style diet. This diet's high fiber content, n-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, as well as phytochemicals from olive oil, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, might be responsible for its beneficial effect on the health of metabolic syndrome patients. This may occur through the reduction of systemic vascular inflammation and endothelium dysfunction without having a drastic effect on body weight. The choice of healthy sources of carbohydrates, fat, and proteins, associated with regular physical activity and avoidance of smoking, is critical to fighting the war against chronic disease."

Insulin resistance and/or increased abdominal (visceral) obesity have been suggested as potential etiological factors. More recently, increasing evidence has associated insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation involving cytokines derived from adipose tissue, or adipocytokines. Despite the fact that precise mechanisms have yet to be established, there is a significant role for both diet and physical activity to improve the many factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, including modulation of various adipocytokines. Although both diet and physical activity have been studied for their ability to modify cytokines in more traditional inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, they have been less studied in relation to inflammation as an underlying cause of the metabolic syndrome and/or CVD. A more thorough understanding of the clustering of metabolic abnormalities and their underlying etiology will help to define diet and physical activity guidelines for preventing and treating the metabolic syndrome, an important aspect of CVD prevention. This paper will address potential underlying causes of the metabolic syndrome, with a focus on the putative mechanistic role of adipocytokines, and will discuss the impact of diet and physical activity on the metabolic syndrome."

Interactions between genetic and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle, particularly over-nutrition and sedentary behavior, promote the progression and pathogenesis of these polygenic diet-related diseases. Their current prevalence is increasing dramatically to epidemic proportions. Nutrition is probably the most important environmental factor that modulates expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways and the variety of phenotypes associated with obesity, the MetS and T2DM. Furthermore, the health effects of nutrients may be modulated by genetic variants. Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics require an understanding of nutrition, genetics, biochemistry and a range of \"omic\" technologies to investigate the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors relevant to metabolic health and disease. These rapidly developing fields of nutritional science hold much promise in improving nutrition for optimal personal and public health.

The first manifestation of metabolic syndrome may occur in pregnancy presenting as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Both conditions are associated with increased insulin resistance. Also metabolic syndrome is more common in polycystic ovarian syndrome. It has been suggested that there is a metabolic syndrome resulting from the menopause due to estrogen deficiency, as many of the risk factors are more prevalent in postmenopausal women. Also estrogen replacement improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of diabetes. The key elements in managing the metabolic syndrome are weight reduction, increasing physical activity and diet modification. If blood pressure, lipid and glycaemic control are not achieved through these interventions then pharmacological therapy will be required."

With urbanization, economic development, and mass marketing, global dietary patterns have become more Westernized to include more sugar-sweetened beverages, highly processed foods, animal-based foods, and fewer fruits and vegetables, which has contributed to increasing cardiovascular disease globally. In this paper, we will examine the trends occurring globally in the realm of nutrition and cardiovascular disease prevention and also present new data that international nutrition knowledge amongst cardiovascular disease providers is limited. In turn, this lack of knowledge has resulted in less patient education and counseling, which is having profound effects on cardiovascular disease prevention efforts worldwide."

Previous studies have linked a gluten-free diet (GFD) to obesity and MetS in some populations. However, others have suggested that weight gain is usually regulated only in underweight individuals with celiac disease (CD). Owing to the lack of sufficient data and the importance of GFD in controlling cardiovascular disease, we surveyed the prevalence of MetS and its components before and after a year of GFD in patients referred to the main celiac clinic in southern Iran. <b>Methods:</b> This was a repeated cross-sectional study conducted on 69 patients with a definite diagnosis of cardiovascular disease who were on follow-up and registered at the Shiraz Celiac Clinic. Demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory measurements at the time of diagnosis and one year after the GFD were extracted from their medical records. <b>Results:</b> The participants' mean age was 35.53, and 68.1% were women. The prevalence of MetS increased from 5.8% to 11.6% after a year of the GFD; however, this increase was not statistically significant. Waist circumference (WC) and serum triglyceride levels were significantly elevated during the study period. <b>Conclusion:</b> A GFD may contribute to the development of MetS in patients with cardiovascular disease; however, the rate of MetS is still lower than that in the general population. It is critical to educate patients about these potential risks and encourage them to have a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and physical activity."

            "abstract": "Nutrition has a central role in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease yet only relatively recently has food been regarded as a treatment, rather than as an adjunct to established medical and pharmacotherapy. As a field of research, nutrition science is constantly evolving making it difficult for patients and practitioners to ascertain best practice. This is compounded further by the inherent difficulties in performing double-blind randomised controlled trials. This paper covers dietary patterns that are associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, including the Mediterranean Diet but also low-carbohydrate diets and the potential issues encountered with their implementation. We suggest there must be a refocus away from macronutrients and consideration of whole foods when advising individuals. This approach is fundamental to practice, as clinical guidelines have focused on macronutrients without necessarily considering their source, and ultimately people consume foods containing multiple nutrients. The inclusion of food-based recommendations aids the practitioner to help the patient make genuine and meaningful changes in their diet. We advocate that the cardioprotective diet constructed around the traditional Mediterranean eating pattern (based around vegetables and fruits, nuts, legumes, and unrefined cereals, with modest amounts of fish and shellfish, and fermented dairy products) is still important. However, there are other approaches that can be tried, including low-carbohydrate diets. We encourage practitioners to adopt a flexible dietary approach, being mindful of patient preferences and other comorbidities that may necessitate deviations away from established advice, and advocate for more dietitians in this field to guide the multi-professional team."

            "abstract": "The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) is a dynamic hair-like layer expressed on the apical surface of endothelial cells throughout the vascular system. This layer serves as an endothelial cell gatekeeper by controlling the permeability and adhesion properties of endothelial cells, as well as by controlling vascular resistance through the mediation of vasodilation. Pathogenic destruction of the eGC could be linked to impaired vascular function, as well as several acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. Defining the precise functions and mechanisms of the eGC is perhaps the limiting factor of the missing link in finding novel treatments for lifestyle-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between diet, lifestyle, and the preservation of the eGC is an unexplored territory. This article provides an overview of the eGC's importance for health and disease and describes perspectives of nutritional therapy for the prevention of the eGC's pathogenic destruction. It is concluded that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, as well as healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the time management of eating, might show promise for preserving eGC health and, thus, the health of the cardiovascular system."

This review investigated the effects of diet on weight management and metabolic outcomes in patients with double diabetes. MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science databases were searched through September 2020. Population- or individual-level dietary interventions, and observational studies investigating dietary patterns in adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity, were eligible for inclusion. The quality of studies was assessed. Four eligible studies were included in this review, comprising two randomized controlled trials, one pretest-posttest study, and one cross-sectional study. Study populations included between 10 and 1040 participants. Dietary interventions included the Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, intermittent fasting, continuous energy restriction, and a combination of fasting and a standardized low-calorie diabetic diet (LCD). Significant weight loss was observed within groups for low-fat diet, Mediterranean diet, fasting, LCD with fasting, intermittent fasting, or continuous energy restriction, but there were no between-group differences. Weight maintenance was only achieved in interventions where fasting or intermittent fasting were present. Dietary interventions in published data failed to demonstrate effects on metabolic syndrome. Larger sample, high-quality trials conducted over longer periods are urgently required to determine the efficacy of diet for weight management and improving metabolic outcomes in individuals with double diabetes. This would provide much needed evidence-based guidance for dietary interventions, which are well known to be the cornerstone of clinical care."

In addition to the genetic predisposition, major negative lifestyle factors are contributing to the alarming outbreak of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among the Asian Indian population; these factors include: 1) a diet high in added sugar, refined grains and other processed foods, 2) physical inactivity, 3) vitamin D deficiency (VDD), and 4) smoking/pollution.

The two major underlying risk factors for the metabolic syndrome are obesity and insulin resistance; exacerbating factors are physical inactivity, advancing age, and endocrine and genetic factors. The condition is progressive, beginning with borderline risk factors that eventually progress to categorical risk factors. In many patients, the metabolic syndrome culminates in type 2 diabetes, which further increases risk for cardiovascular disease. Primary treatment of the metabolic syndrome is lifestyle therapy--weight loss, increased physical activity, and anti-atherogenic diet. But as the condition progresses, drug therapies directed toward the individual risk factors might be required. Ultimately, it might be possible to develop drugs that will simultaneously modify all of the risk factors.

DESIGN: Review of the available literature in relation to Mediterranean diet and metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Several components of Mediterranean diet patterns have been inversely related with body mass index. They are considered to be modulators of insulin resistance, can exert beneficial effects on blood pressure, improve atherogenic dyslipidemia or attenuate the inflammatory burden associated with metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been associated with dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables, nuts, olive oil, legumes and fish, moderate in alcohol and low in red meat, processed meat, refined carbohydrates and whole-fat dairy products. CONCLUSIONS: There is much evidence suggesting that the Mediterranean diet could serve as an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which could help to fight diseases related to chronic inflammation, including metabolic syndrome."

These trends are primarily driven by aging populations and by the increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome describes an association between diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It is in large part the result of unbalanced diet and sedentary lifestyle. These essentially modifiable risk factors are becoming more prevalent with the widespread adoption of so-called Western lifestyles. This review examines the physiology underlying the link between the metabolic syndrome and AF. Next, it highlights the importance of addressing lifestyle-related risk factors to mitigate the trend toward increasing AF prevalence. It then goes on to discuss the importance of stroke prevention therapy in patients with established AF, focusing on the relative merits of various available options for anticoagulation. Given the recent availability of comprehensive data on the 4 currently available non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drugs, this review concludes by discussing the relative merits of specific agents in individual patient groups."

Consideration of the type and amount of carbohydrate, protein and fat is required for optimal blood glucose control, for clinical outcomes related to renal function and for consideration of risk reduction for cardiovascular disease. Controversy has existed regarding the clinical significance of a protein-controlled diet, not to mention the ideal recommended intake in view of the benefits and risks. Furthermore, the level of CKD with which to implement dietary changes should also be considered. This review seeks to provide guidance and clarity concerning the nutritional management of CKD in diabetes."

            "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in diagnosis and understanding of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world's developed countries. The metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors (visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension), is increasingly being recognized as a new risk factor for type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, there is wide variation in both the occurrence of disease and age of onset, even in individuals who display very similar risk profiles. There is now compelling evidence that a complex interplay between genetic determinants and environmental factors (still largely unknown) is the reason for this large inter-individual variation in disease susceptibility. The purpose of the present review is to describe the current status of our knowledge concerning the gene-environment interactions potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It focuses predominantly on studies of genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, alcohol dehydrogenase type 1C, apolipoprotein E, glutathione S-transferases T1 and M1) that are known to be modified by dietary and lifestyle habits (fat diet, intake of alcohol and smoking habit). It also describes the limited current understanding of the role of genetic variants of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and their interactions with environmental toxicants. Additional studies are needed in order to clarify whether inter-individual differences in detoxification of environmental toxicants may have an essential role in the development of CVD and contribute to the emerging field of \"environmental cardiology\". Such knowledge may be particularly relevant for improving cardiovascular risk stratification and conceiving the development of \"personalized intervention program\"."

A number of risk factors such as family history, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking and physical inactivity are responsible for a significant proportion of the overall cardiovascular risk. Interestingly, recent data suggest there is a gradient in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease across the spectrum of socioeconomic status, as this is defined by educational level, occupation or income. Additionally, dietary mediators seem to play significant role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, mediating some of the discrepancies in atherosclerosis among different socioeconomic layers. Therefore, in the present article, we aim to review the association between socioeconomic status and cardiovascular disease risk factors and the role of different dietary mediators."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome are more common in GDM women, and even the offspring of GDM women are reported to have higher obesity rates and a higher risk for noncommunicable diseases. Early prevention of risk factors seems to be key to overcoming the vicious cycle of cardiometabolic disease onset."

Components of the Mediterranean diet associated with better cardiovascular health include low consumption of meat and meat products, moderate consumption of ethanol (mostly from wine), and high consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, and olive oil. Increasing evidence indicates that the synergy among these components results in beneficial changes in intermediate pathways of cardiometabolic risk, such as lipids, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoreactivity. As a result, consumption of a Mediterranean dietary pattern favorably affects numerous cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Moreover, strong evidence links this dietary pattern with reduced cardiovascular disease incidence, reoccurrence, and mortality. This review evaluates the current evidence behind the cardioprotective effects of a Mediterranean dietary pattern."

RESULTS: the essential features most frequently involved the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome. Inadequate nutrition and physical inactivity were highlighted as the most common antecedents of the syndrome, and the outcomes were occurrences of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus type 2. As implication, we highlight relevant empirical data to the broad definition of the concept. CONCLUSION: we could analyze the concept under study regarding essential features, antecedents, and outcomes, operationally defining it as a potential nursing phenomenon, which demands health care focusing on reducing risks and morbidity and mortality for cardiovascular diseases."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a global reference dietary pattern. Although research on the EAT-Lancet reference diet and its associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dietary environmental impacts, and cost of diets is increasing, studies done in low-income and middle-income countries remain scarce. This study aimed to assess the health outcomes, environmental impacts, and dietary costs of adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet in China. METHODS: In this health and nutrition survey study, 16 029 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort (1997-2015) were included at baseline. All-cause mortality was reported by family members and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes was self-reported. 3-day 24 h recall was used to assess adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet (Eat-Lancet Diet Index [ELDI]), diet-related environmental impacts (greenhouse-gas emissions [GHGE]), total water use (TWU), land use, and dietary costs in each survey round. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the ELDI-score were obtained by Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for potential confounders. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the association of environmental impacts and dietary costs to the ELDI score. FINDINGS: During a median follow-up of 9·86 years, 803 new cases of incident type 2 diabetes, 563 new cases of cardiovascular disease, and 908 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. At baseline, the ELDI score ranged from 9·4 points to 110·8 points on a scale of 0 to 140, with a mean of 55·3 points (SD 11·8). With each SD increase in the ELDI score, there was an 8% decreased risk of mortality (95% CI 2·2-14·1), a 16·1% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (9·2-20·3), and a 25·3% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (19·5- 28·4). Each SD increase in the index was associated with a decrease of 2·2% (95% CI -2·6 to -1·8) in GHGE, 2·3% (-2·6 to -2·0) in land use, no association with TWU, but an increase in diet costs of 3·3% (2·8 to 3·8). INTERPRETATION: High adherence to the ELDI was associated with a lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the association with diet-related GHGE and land use was modest, and adherence was also linked to higher diet costs. The study advocates for the integration of sustainable indicators into future Chinese dietary guidelines. Additionally, policy measures such as agricultural subsidies on fruit and vegetable and carbon taxes on red meat are recommended to increase affordability, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the overall sustainability of dietary practices in China.

Some investigators have argued that excessive sugar consumption is associated with increased risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and stimulation of reward pathways in the brain potentially causing excessive caloric consumption. These concerns have influenced organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in England not to exceed 5 % of total energy and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee 2015 to recommend upper limits of sugar consumption not to exceed 10 % of calories. Data from many randomized control trials (RCTs) do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse metabolic and health-related effects. Fructose and glucose are typically consumed together in roughly equal proportions from high-fructose corn syrup (also known as isoglucose in Europe) or sucrose. The purpose of this review is to present data from recent RCTs and findings from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to sugar consumption and its putative health effects. This review evaluates findings from recent randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses into the relationship of sugar consumption and a range of health-related issues including energy-regulating hormones, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and accumulation of liver fat and neurologic responses. Data from these sources do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse metabolic and health-related effects."

It is a collection of risk factors that includes insulin resistance, central obesity, arterial hypertension, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. The presence of these risk factors increases the probability of developing diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, increasing coronary and cardiovascular mortality. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the US has increased in the past years due to an increased incidence of obesity and physical inactivity. Diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome can be done with the use of established criteria by the NCEP-ATP III and the WHO. The principal treatment for this condition is to modify life styles, most importantly, diet and exercise. In many cases, this intervention alone is not sufficient to control these risk factors and a more aggressive intervention is required, including drugs directed to each risk factor independently to avoid complications due to the development of cardiovascular disease associated to the syndrome."

To reduce the impact of CVD, targeting modifiable risk factors comprised in metabolic syndrome (e.g., waist circumference, lipid profile, blood pressure, and blood glucose) is of great importance. Beneficial effects of fish consumption on CVD has been revealed over the past decades, and some studies suggest that fish consumption may have a protective role in preventing metabolic syndrome. Fish contains a variety of nutrients that may contribute to health benefits. This review examines current recommendations for fish intake as a source of various nutrients (proteins, n-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, iodine, selenium, and taurine), and their effects on metabolic syndrome and the CVD risk factors. Fatty fish is recommended due to its high levels of n-3 fatty acids, however lean fish also contains nutrients that may be beneficial in the prevention of CVD."

Physicians need a better understanding of the role of diet in shaping fetal outcomes. Given this background, we reviewed and summarized articles on maternal nutrition found in MEDLINE since 1981, written in English, and limited to human subjects. FOR THE OFFSPRING: Maternal diets high in sugar and fat lead to an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life. Folic acid should be supplemented prior to conception and continued through at least the first 28 days of fetal life to prevent neural tube defects, and vitamin C should be given to women who smoke to lower the incidence of asthma and wheezing in the children. Iodine deficiency is increasing, and iodine should be included in prenatal supplements. If the maternal hemoglobin is 7 g/dL or more, there is no evidence that iron supplementation is needed. Fish intake during pregnancy is protective against atopic outcomes, whereas high-meat diets contribute to elevated adult blood pressure and hypersecretion of cortisol. FOR THE MOTHER: Calcium supplementation lowers the risk of preeclampsia and hypertensive disease in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limits of our current knowledge, a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and selected fish is desirable for the best outcomes. Diets high in sugar and fat lead to higher rates of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Folic acid, iodine, and calcium in all pregnant women and vitamin C in smokers are the only supplements so far shown to be of value for routine use. The physician treating a pregnant woman should be ready to advise a healthy diet for the benefit of the fetus."

RECENT FINDINGS: Existing safety net programs have shown to be effective at improving food security and diet quality and reducing risk for CVD, but continued efforts to increase reach and improve standards are needed. Adoption of policies, healthcare initiatives, and community- and individual-level interventions addressing the nutritional intake of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may also lessen CVD burden, but scaling interventions remains a key challenge. Research suggests simultaneously addressing food security and diet quality is feasible and could help reduce socioeconomic disparities in CVD morbidity and mortality. Intervening at multiple levels among high-risk groups should be a priority."

A rapidly growing number of studies in recent years support the hypothesis that the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has a beneficial effect on certain body systems, but the highly varied objectives and quality of these publications warrants an updated assessment. In the present review we performed a comprehensive evaluation of current evidence on the impact of the MedDiet on human health, assessing its effect on the incidence or progression of the main non-communicable diseases and their intermediate outcomes and risk factors. We scrutinised the clinical evidence from observational studies and randomised controlled trials. Cardiovascular disease was the condition with most information. The MedDiet showed a general preventive effect, which was reproduced to varying degrees for certain intermediate cardiovascular outcomes such as blood pressure, lipids, obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Benefits were also found for several types of cancer, brain function (including cognition, mood and to a lesser extent Parkinson's disease) and mortality. The quality of the published evidence was, however, generally moderate or low. In conclusion, the MedDiet shows a favourable impact on health. General adoption of a MedDiet is concordant with current policies promoting healthy and sustainable nutrition worldwide. Nonetheless, more high-quality research is needed to improve the consistency of the findings."

It is estimated that approximately 25% of the world's population has MetS. In the United States, MetS is more common in men and Hispanics, and its incidence increases with age. Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying risk factors include insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. Confusion about MetS exists in part due to the lack of a consensus definition and treatment protocol. Treatment of MetS begins with therapeutic lifestyle changes and then pharmacologic treatment of the syndrome's individual components. Effective interventions include diet modification, exercise, and use of pharmacologic agents to treat risk factors. Weight loss and increasing physical activity significantly improve all aspects of MetS. A diet that includes more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, monounsaturated fats, and low-fat dairy products will benefit most patients with MetS. Physicians can be most effective in advising patients by customizing specific lifestyle recommendations after assessing patients for the presence of risk factors."

Suboptimal diet quality is responsible for a greater percentage of CVD-related morbidity and mortality than any other modifiable risk factor. Further troubling are the stark racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in diet quality. This represents a major public health concern that urgently requires a coordinated effort to better characterize the barriers to healthy dietary practices in population groups disproportionally affected by CVD and poor diet quality to inform multifaceted approaches at the government (policy), community environment, sociocultural, and individual levels. This paper reviews the barriers, opportunities, and challenges involved in shifting population behaviors, especially in underserved populations, toward healthy dietary practices. It is imperative that public health policies address the social determinants of nutrition more intensively than previously in order to significantly decrease CVD on a population-wide basis."

Lifestyle interventions, particularly plant-based nutrition and exercise, are essential for managing MetS. While both strategies are well-documented independently, their synergistic effects remain less explored. This narrative review integrates findings from both domains to evaluate their combined impact on metabolic syndrome. The review examines the individual and combined impacts of plant-based nutrition and exercise on MetS-related metabolic dysfunction. METHODS: A comprehensive review of 114 peer-reviewed studies was conducted to assess the role of plant-based diets and structured physical activity in improving insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, inflammation, and weight management. Studies investigating the mechanisms through which dietary components and exercise modalities influence metabolic health were analyzed, along with behavioral and psychological factors affecting long-term adherence. RESULTS: Plant-based diets, particularly those high in fiber, polyphenols, and healthy fats, improve glucose metabolism, reduce inflammation, and enhance cardiovascular health. Exercise complements these benefits by increasing insulin sensitivity, promoting fat oxidation, and improving lipid metabolism. When combined, plant-based nutrition and exercise provide superior metabolic outcomes, including greater reductions in visceral adiposity, improved endothelial function, and enhanced glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Plant-based nutrition and structured exercise are effective strategies for managing MetS. Their synergistic effects highlight the importance of integrated lifestyle interventions for long-term metabolic health."

Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of a variety of metabolic disturbances including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood sugar. Although the risk for metabolic syndrome has largely been attributed to adult lifestyle factors such as poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and smoking, there is now strong evidence suggesting that predisposition to the development of metabolic syndrome begins in utero. First posited by Hales and Barker in 1992, the \"thrifty phenotype\" hypothesis proposes that susceptibility to adult chronic diseases can occur in response to exposures in the prenatal and perinatal periods. This hypothesis has been continually supported by epidemiologic studies and studies involving animal models. In this review, we describe the structural, metabolic and epigenetic changes that occur in response to adverse intrauterine environments including prenatal and postnatal diet, maternal obesity, and pregnancy complications. Given the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in both the developed and developing worlds, a greater understanding and appreciation for the role of the intrauterine environment in adult chronic disease etiology is imperative."

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affects almost half of the Navajo population. The diet of the Navajo, heavy in fat and refined carbohydrates, has been identified as an important contributing factor to the high rates of metabolic syndrome in this population. DESIGN: A search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL to identify studies published before October, 2013, involving nutrition-based interventions in adult populations similar to the Navajo targeting at least one measure of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Data on efficacy and participation were gathered and synthesised qualitatively. RESULTS: Out of 19 studies included in this systematic review, 11 interventions were identified to be effective at improving at least one measure of metabolic syndrome. Level of exposure to the intervention, frequency of intervention activities, family and social support, cultural adaptation and case management were identified as factors that may improve the efficacy of an intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple nutrition-based interventions have been found to be effective in populations similar to the Navajo. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Development of a strategy to address metabolic syndrome in the Navajo may involve aspects from multiple interventions to increase efficacy and maximise participation."

Intake of carbohydrates (CHO), particularly a sugary diet that rapidly increases blood glucose, triglycerides, and blood pressure levels is the predominant determining factor of MetS. Complex CHO, on the other hand, are a stable source of energy taking a longer time to digest. In particular, resistant starch (RS) or soluble fiber is an excellent source of prebiotics, which alter the gut microbial composition, which in turn improves metabolic control. Altering maternal CHO intake during pregnancy may result in the child developing MetS. Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity in combination with dietary habits may synergistically influence gene expression by modulating genetic and epigenetic regulators transforming childhood obesity into adolescent metabolic disorders. This review summarizes the common pathophysiology of MetS in connection with the nature of CHO, intrauterine nutrition, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and advanced treatment approaches; it also emphasizes how dietary CHO may act as a key element in the pathogenesis and future therapeutic targets of obesity and MetS."

MS is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. MS is common, affecting a quarter to a third of adults, and its prevalence is rising, in parallel with increasing obesity and population ageing. Operational definitions of MS have been proposed by the World Health Organization and the National Cholesterol Education Program. Recently, the International Diabetes Federation proposed a global definition that emphasised the importance of central adiposity. In cardiovascular risk assessment, MS encapsulates the contribution of non-traditional risk factors and provides a clinically useful framework for early identification of people at increased long-term risk. It should be used in conjunction with standard algorithms based on conventional risk factors, which better predict short-term risk. Management of MS should emphasise lifestyle interventions (eg, physical activity, healthy diet and weight reduction) to reduce long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Those at increased short-term risk should also have individual risk factors treated according to established guidelines."

This review addresses the effect of eggs on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from both epidemiological research and controlled prospective studies, in people with and without cardio-metabolic disease. It also examines the nutritional qualities of eggs and whether they may offer protection against chronic disease. The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended (at least in some countries) may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM. In conclusion, an approach focused on a person's entire dietary intake as opposed to specific foods or nutrients should be the heart of population nutrition guidelines."

The metabolic syndrome is a complex disorder, therefore its treatment should be multifactorial and intensive. MetS occurs due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Each of MetS components is a well-known risk factor of atherosclerosis. Such modifications to the lifestyle as increasing physical activity, introducing a well-balanced diet and reducing the body mass are associated with reduced occurrence of MetS and its individual components. It is necessary to implement proper dietary processes, a physical training program and pharmacological treatment. The treatment of MetS should begin with weight loss, which affects the occurrence of abdominal obesity, as well as increased physical activity, leading to an increased tissue sensitivity to insulin. It is recommended to introduce a low-energy, individually balanced diet that will lead to a 7-10% weight loss over the course of 6-12 months. Patients are also advised to quit smoking and limit the consumption of salt and alcohol."

We evaluated whether elevated CRP levels modify the relationship of metabolic syndrome and diabetes with CVD in U.S. adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 3,873 subjects (weighted to 156 million) aged >/=18 years participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000, subjects were classified as having diabetes, metabolic syndrome according to modified National Cholesterol Education Program criteria, or neither condition by low (<1 mg/l), intermediate (1-3 mg/l), or high (>3 mg/l) CRP levels. Logistic regression examined the odds of CVD by disease condition and CRP group. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and total cholesterol, compared with those with neither metabolic syndrome nor diabetes and low CRP levels, the odds of CVD were 1.99 (95% CI 1.10-3.59) for those with no disease and high CRP levels and 2.67 (1.30-5.48) for those with metabolic syndrome and intermediate CRP. Persons with metabolic syndrome but high CRP had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.33 (1.80-6.16), similar to those with diabetes and low CRP (3.21 [1.27-8.09]). The likelihood of CVD was highest in those with diabetes who had intermediate CRP levels (6.01 [2.54-14.20]) and in those with diabetes and high CRP (7.73 [3.99-14.95]). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional analysis, CVD is more common in those with metabolic syndrome or diabetes who have elevated CRP. Stratification by CRP may add prognostic information in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes."

Current advances have suggested that the metabolic syndrome (MS) is a programmable disease, which is characterized by epigenetic modifications of vital genes when exposed to oxidative stress. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to critically review the central context of MS while presenting the most recent knowledge related to epigenetic alterations that are promoted by oxidative stress. Potential pro-oxidant mechanisms that orchestrate changes in methylation profiling and are related to obesity, diabetes and hypertension are discussed. It is anticipated that the identification and understanding of the role of DNA methylation marks could be used to uncover early predictors and define drugs or diet-related treatments able to delay or reverse epigenetic changes, thereby combating MS burden."

METHODS: A systematic review and Bayesian mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis was conducted. Relevant electronic bibliographic databases were searched up to January 2010. Included studies were randomized controlled trials with a follow-up of ≥24 weeks and outcomes comparing incidence of diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease, or reversal of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies with outcome data for reversal of metabolic syndrome, involving 3907 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. Insufficient trials reported cardiovascular events/mortality, or incidence of type 2 diabetes, to conduct a meta-analysis for these outcomes. Interventions, alone or in combination, included lifestyle (diet and/or exercise) and pharmacological therapy. Using random-effect models, both lifestyle (odds ratio, OR 3.81; 95% confidence interval, CI 2.47-5.88) and pharmacological interventions (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04-2.45) were statistically superior compared with control for reversing metabolic syndrome. Using mixed treatment comparison methods, the probability that lifestyle interventions were the most clinically effective was 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can reverse metabolic syndrome. However, there is a lack of data on whether these benefits are sustained and translate into longer term prevention of diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease."

Scientific evidence has suggested that <i>LINE-1</i> methylation is associated with body composition and obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). It also has been evaluated as predictor of weight loss. The studies' results are still conflicting, and positive and negative associations have been found to <i>LINE-1</i> methylation regarding adiposity and cardiometabolic markers.

TEACHING POINTS Epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the etiology of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Many studies have related methylation of <i>LINE-1</i> with cardiometabolic diseases; however, the results are still controversial. The relationship between the etiology of chronic diseases and the methylation of <i>LINE-1</i> is not fully elucidated. With advances in epigenetic studies, related mechanisms may be early biomarkers in weight change and cardiometabolic risk."

It also highlights links between this continuum of deteriorating glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease are all related to diet and to the level of physical activity. They have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Glucose intolerance and diabetes increase the risk of atherosclerotic events. Moreover, obesity, and glucose intolerance or diabetes, are components of the metabolic syndrome, which also imparts an increased cardiovascular risk. There is increasing recognition that common mechanisms contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Following increased calorie intake and/or decreased physical activity, fuel metabolism generates excess of 'toxic' metabolites, particularly glucose and fatty acids. Homeostasis is affected by the endocrine output from the adipose tissue. Reactive oxygen species are generated, creating oxidative stress, which exerts major effects on signaling pathways, further affecting cellular metabolism and triggering low-grade inflammatory reaction. This perspective on the diabetic syndrome has been reflected in the approach to its treatment, which integrates maintenance of glycemic control with primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention. Laboratory medicine should support diabetes care with an integrated package of tests which, in addition to glycemic control, enable assessment and monitoring of the risk of microvascular complications as well as cardiovascular disease."

SA KTR experience increased major adverse cardiovascular events both early and late post-transplantation. Cardiovascular risk management should therefore begin well before transplantation. SA candidates may require aggressive screening for pre-transplant cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to their ethnicity and comorbidities. Recording SA ethnicity during the pre-transplant evaluation may enable programs to better assess cardiovascular risk, thus allowing for earlier targeted peri- and post-transplant intervention to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Diabetes remains the most prominent post-transplant cardiovascular risk factor in SA KTR. Diabetes also clusters with other metabolic syndrome components including lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, hypertension, and central obesity in this population. Dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and obesity are all significant CVD risk factors in SA KTR, and contribute to increased insulin resistance. Novel biomarkers such as adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a) may be especially important to study in SA KTR. Focused interventions to improve health behaviors involving diet and exercise may especially benefit SA KTR. However, there are few interventional clinical trials specific to the SA population, and none are specific to SA KTR. In all cases, understanding the nuances of managing SA KTR as a distinct post-transplant group, while still screening for and managing each CVD risk factor individually in all patients may help improve the long-term success of all kidney transplant programs catering to multi-ethnic populations."

In fact, a number of systematic reviews have shown the association between inflammatory biomarkers, such as CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-4, or IL-10, and cardio-metabolic diseases. Diet is one of the main lifestyle-related factors which modulates the inflammatory process. Different individual foods and dietary patterns can have a beneficial health effect associated with their anti-inflammatory properties. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) was recently developed to estimate the inflammatory potential of overall diet. The aim of this review is to examine the findings of recent papers that have investigated the association between the DII, cardio-metabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease. The relevance of the DII score in the association between inflammation and cardio-metabolic diseases is critically appraised, as well as its role in the context of healthy dietary patterns. We conclude that the DII score seems to be a useful tool to appraise the inflammatory capacity of the diet and to better understand the relationships between diet, inflammation, and cardio-metabolic diseases."

Although the metabolic syndrome has been defined in various ways, the ultimate importance of recognizing this combination of disorders is that it helps identify individuals at high risk for both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Evidence from observational and experimental studies links adverse exposures in early life, particularly relating to nutrition, to chronic disease susceptibility in adulthood. Such studies provide the foundation and framework for the relatively new field of developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). Although great strides have been made in identifying the putative concepts and mechanisms relating specific exposures in early life to the risk of developing chronic diseases in adulthood, a complete picture remains obscure. To date, the main focus of the field has been on perinatal undernutrition and specific nutrient deficiencies; however, the current global health crisis of overweight and obesity demands that perinatal overnutrition and specific nutrient excesses be examined. This paper assembles current thoughts on the concepts and mechanisms behind the DOHaD as they relate to maternal nutrition, and highlights specific contributions made by macro- and micronutrients."

The gender variations are a consequence of the different rate of decrease of sexual hormones in males and females and of the protective roles they play during adulthood and older age phases."

We review the current evidence linking ultra-processed foods and cardiometabolic health risk and provide recommendations for action at the clinical and public health levels. RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of evidence conducted in a variety of study populations supports an association between ultra-processed food intake and increased risk of metabolic syndrome, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity trajectories, and cardiovascular disease. The strongest evidence is observed in relation to weight gain and obesity among adults, as this association is supported by high-quality epidemiological and experimental evidence. Accumulating epidemiologic evidence and putative biological mechanisms link ultra-processed foods to cardiometabolic health outcomes. The high intake of ultra-processed foods in all population groups and its associated risks make ultra-processed foods an ideal target for intensive health promotion messaging and interventions."

            "abstract": "The decades-long dietary experiment embodied in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) focused on limiting fat, especially saturated fat, and higher carbohydrate intake has coincided with rapidly escalating epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) that are contributing to the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other diet-related chronic diseases. Moreover, the lack of flexibility in the DGA as it pertains to low carbohydrate approaches does not align with the contemporary trend toward precision nutrition. We argue that personalizing the level of dietary carbohydrate should be a high priority based on evidence that Americans have a wide spectrum of metabolic variability in their tolerance to high carbohydrate loads. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and T2D are conditions strongly associated with insulin resistance, a condition exacerbated by increased dietary carbohydrate and improved by restricting carbohydrate. Low-carbohydrate diets are grounded across the time-span of human evolution, have well-established biochemical principles, and are now supported by multiple clinical trials in humans that demonstrate consistent improvements in multiple established risk factors associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently recognized a low carbohydrate eating pattern as an effective approach for patients with diabetes. Despite this evidence base, low-carbohydrate diets are not reflected in the DGA. As the DGA Dietary Patterns have not been demonstrated to be universally effective in addressing the needs of many Americans and recognizing the lack of widely available treatments for obesity, metabolic syndrome, and T2D that are safe, effective, and sustainable, the argument for an alternative, low-carbohydrate Dietary Pattern is all the more compelling."

This study aimed to explore the relationship between estimated glucose metabolic rate (eGDR) and MS. The correlation between eGDR levels and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was analyzed here based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2020. The study sample consisted of 63,131 adult participants, and the results showed that lower eGDR levels were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Further regression analyses showed that eGDR acted as a protective factor and that the risk of MS significantly decreased as its level increased. Subgroup analyses showed that this trend held across gender, age, and BMI categories, and that the protective effect of eGDR was weaker in the higher BMI group. Based on the nonlinear relationship between subjects' eGDR levels and MS prevalence, RCS analyses further confirmed a significant correlation between lower eGDR levels and increased risk of MS. In conclusion, the present study suggests that eGDR levels could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting metabolic syndrome, providing new perspectives for early screening and intervention of MS."

Recent evidence described in this review highlights how dietary factors may influence cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through modulation of miRNA expression. Additionally, circulating miRNAs are emerging as putative biomarkers of disease, susceptibility, and perhaps dietary exposure. Research needs to move beyond associations in cells and animals to understanding the direct effects of diet and dietary supplements on miRNA expression and function in human health and disease."

Solid epidemiological and trial evidence support lifestyle changes as the main modifiable risk factors, including abdominal obesity, sedentary lifestyle and a diet rich in saturated fat and low in fiber content, in the treatment of individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Physical activity may prevent the metabolic syndrome as defined by the WHO and NCEP, but the evidence for lifestyle changes using these definitions is still sparse. No trials on the treatment of the metabolic syndrome to prevent diabetes have been published. However, both the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the Diabetes Prevention Program found that moderate lifestyle interventions in persons with impaired glucose tolerance, a condition related to the metabolic syndrome. decreased the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58%. Some drugs may also prevent diabetes. Further research on lifestyle modifications in the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome, and on how best to promote lifestyle changes, is needed. In the meantime, efforts to curb obesity and overweight, increase physical activity and improve compliance with current dietary recommendations should continue."

This association is named Metabolic Syndrome. Despite the existence thereof had been questioned by the ADA and EASD, it is a useful tool affording the possibility of identifying individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Metabolic syndrome and/or its individual components are associated with a high incidence rate of cardiovascular disease. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are underlying risk factors along this syndrome's pathway to disease, changes in living habits therefore being a first-line intervention in the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, aterogenic dyslipemia and arterial hypertension. Weight loss and exercise are the keys to the overall plan, one of the most important non-pharmacological cardiovascular risk reduction strategies however still being diet. Epidemiological studies have found a high intake of simple sugars, of foods having a glycemic index and of diets with a high glycemic load to be associated to insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol figures. Los saturated fat intake in favor of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids has been implied in a reduction of the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus and dyslipemia, although the debate is ongoing. Unrefined grain fiber in the diet has been beneficial in reducing the risk of diabetes. Among the diet patterns, the Mediterranean diet has been related to a lower incidence of diabetes and a reduction in the risk of death. Studies for intervention in the prevention of type II diabetes have suggested low-fat diets (reducing saturated and trans-fats), with a high degree of fiber and low glycemic index. Clinical trials have shown diets with small amounts of carbohydrates, low glycemic index and the Mediterranean and DASH diets to be beneficial in reducing aterogenic dyslipemia. There is currently no good evidence for choosing diets with restricted carbohydrates. On the other hand, different guides recommend low-calorie diets with a low content in saturated fats, trans-fats, cholesterol and sugars in favor the eating fruits, green vegetables, unrefined grains and fish."

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in multiple science databases and limited to studies published after 2012, in English language and peer reviewed. The data from selected articles were extracted and a qualitative approach was employed due to heterogeneity of results. RESULTS: Newborns from obese fathers showed altered methylation overall and significant hypomethylation at the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) gene. High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was associated with altered offspring DNA methylation levels and gestational diabetes mellitus induced significantly increased methylation levels in offspring. Gestational weight gain was not associated with differentially methylated cord blood. Birth weight was higher in offspring exposed to famine in early gestation. Offspring born post maternal bariatric surgery showed a lower percentage of body fat and improved fasting insulin levels compared to siblings born pre-maternal bariatric surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that poor maternal and paternal periconceptional nutrition can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring, through epigenetic imprinting. Potential parents should be advised that maintaining a healthy diet and BMI is likely to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring."

Currently, many children and adolescents are not meeting recommended intakes of key dietary components while also overconsuming sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. OBJECTIVE: To determine if previous lifestyle intervention trials have been effective in improving diet quality or cardiometabolic parameters in youth. METHODS: A review of current literature was completed to determine current nutrient intake in youth, outcomes of previous lifestyle intervention trials, and recent data on confounding nutrition factors such as school-based meals and disordered eating. RESULTS: Studies demonstrate nutrition counseling and lifestyle modification improve cardiometabolic health parameters, but results vary based on duration/intensity of the intervention and degree of parental involvement. CONCLUSION: Studies demonstrate heart-healthy eating is achievable in youth, with trials showing improvements made to diet quality and nutrition-related cardiometabolic health markers. However, special considerations relevant to this age group should be considered when devising a nutrition care plan, as they may confound the progress in achieving a heart-healthy eating style."

Cadmium enters the human body through occupational exposure, diet, drinking water, breathing, and smoking. Cadmium accumulation in the human body is associated with increased risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Cadmium uptake is enhanced during pregnancy and can cross the placenta affecting placental development and function. Subsequently, cadmium can pass to fetus, gathering in multiple organs such as the liver and pancreas. Early-life cadmium exposure can induce hepatic oxidative stress and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, resulting in insulin resistance and glucose metabolic dyshomeostasis in the offspring. Prenatal exposure to cadmium is also associated with increasing epigenetic effects on the offspring's multi-organ functions. However, whether and how maternal exposure to low-dose cadmium impacts the risks of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the young and/or adult offspring remains unclear. This review collected available data to address the current evidence for the potential role of cadmium exposure, leading to insulin resistance and the development of T2D in offspring. However, this review reveals that underlying mechanisms linking prenatal cadmium exposure during pregnancy with T2D in offspring remain to be adequately investigated."

The prevalence of this syndrome is increasing because of the 'obesity epidemic'. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III defined practical criteria for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome and established the basic principles for its management. Also, the International Diabetes Federation recently proposed another definition. The metabolic syndrome is a secondary target for cardiovascular risk reduction. Clinicians should identify individuals with this condition, assess their cardiovascular risk and treat them by an aggressive and multifaceted approach. The most effective therapeutic intervention in patients with the metabolic syndrome should focus on modest weight reduction and regular physical activity. Adoption of a healthier diet and smoking cessation are necessary. Drug therapy may be needed to achieve recommended goals if therapeutic lifestyle changes are not sufficient. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the primary target of therapy (new aggressive goals should be achieved). Statins are probably the drugs of choice. Fibrates and nicotinic acid are also useful options. Hypertension should be managed aggressively probably starting with an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system or a calcium channel blocker and adding a low dose of a thiazide diuretic if necessary. Aspirin should be administered if the cardiovascular risk is high. In the future acarbose, metformin, meglitinides and thiazolidinediones may be used in patients with the metabolic syndrome to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and reduce cardiovascular risk. Such an intense and multifactorial approach is likely to reverse the bad prognosis associated with the metabolic syndrome."

Classical CVD risk factors are common, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and smoking. Moreover, imprisonment is associated with an increased incidence of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, with coping mechanisms, including substance abuse, being frequently adopted. Specific attitudes in the correctional environment, including hunger strikes, bullying, abuse and solitary confinement, are effectors of cardiovascular and mental ill-health. Furthermore, the plethora of psychological stressors induces an accelerated aging process, paired with CVD risk. Communicable diseases, mainly human immunodeficiency virus, opportunistic infections and inadequate sunlight exposure increase cardiovascular dysregulation. Health care needs associated with the female sex are not always met, adding to the frustration and compromised well-being. All these factors act independently and cumulatively, increasing CVD risk among incarcerated women."

RECENT FINDINGS: Diabetes increases the risk of both cardiovascular disease and bone fragility fractures, sharing common pathogenic pathways, including OPG/RANK/RANKL, the FGF23/Klotho axis, calciotropic hormones, and circulating osteogenic cells. This may offer new therapeutic targets for future treatment strategies. As lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone of diabetes treatment, there is potential for an impact on the bone-vascular axis. Evidence published suggests the bone-vascular axis encompasses key pathways for cardiovascular disease. This, along with studies showing physical activity plays a crucial role in the prevention of both bone fragility and cardiovascular disease, suggests that lifestyle intervention incorporating exercise and diet may be helpful in managing skeletal health decline in diabetes. Studies investigating the controversial role of high-fiber diet and dietary vitamin D/calcium on bone and cardiovascular health suggest an overall benefit, but further investigations are needed in this regard."

The Diet-Heart Hypothesis posited that dietary fat is the culprit. Yet dietary fat reduction has contributed to the problem, not resolved it. The role of hyperinsulinemia, the genesis of its atherogenic dyslipidemia and systemic inflammation in CVD and its reversal is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Overnutrition leads to weight gain and carbohydrate intolerance creating a vicious cycle of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia inhibiting fat utilization and encouraging fat storage leading to an atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, and small dense LDL. The carbohydrate-insulin model better accounts for the pathogenesis of obesity, MetS, and ultimately type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and CVD. Ketogenic Diets reduce visceral obesity, increase insulin sensitivity, reverse the atherogenic dyslipidemia and the inflammatory biomarkers of overnutrition. Recent trials show very high adherence to ketogenic diet for up to 2 years in individuals with T2DM, reversing their metabolic, inflammatory and dysglycemic biomarkers as well as the 10-year estimated atherosclerotic risk. Diabetes reversal occurred in over 50% and complete remission in nearly 8%. SUMMARY: Therapeutic carbohydrate-restricted can prevent or reverse the components of MetS and T2DM."

It is a precursor to type 2 diabetes and a powerful independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle changes, such as a diet high in saturated fats and a lack of physical exercise, have contributed to a worldwide increase in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated complications. Identification and effective management of patients with the metabolic syndrome is important to reduce their risk of subsequent disease. Lifestyle modifications are an essential first step, and lipid-lowering therapy may also be required to achieve the lipid goals set out in current treatment guidelines. Statins are the most effective class of lipid-lowering drugs. Recent studies in patients with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome have shown that rosuvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin, simvastatin or pravastatin in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and enabling patients to reach lipid goals."

It is also controversial - its value in predicting cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk and in guiding therapy has been challenged. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to provide advice on the diagnosis of the MetSy and the principles for its prevention and management in the context of primary care, taking into consideration aetiological factors and the complexity of managing its constituent risk factors. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of the MetSy is useful in focusing attention on central adiposity and insulin resistance as risk factors both for the syndrome, and cardiovascular and diabetes morbidity and mortality. Its assessment requires measurement of waist circumference - a simple but seldom performed procedure in general practice. The most essential components for the prevention and management of the MetSy are measures to change diet and physical activity in order to achieve and sustain weight loss."

Moreover, growing evidence has called into question classical nutritional approaches such as the low-fat diet for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and the low-protein diet for the prevention of diabetic kidney disease. Similarly, the recommended nutrition therapy for diabetes may change in near future. Such changes in nutrition therapy must be dynamic and based on not only scientific evidence but also each patient's narrative."

            "abstract": "Recent data suggests that (pre)diabetes onset is preceded by a period of hyperinsulinemia. Consumption of the \"modern\" Western diet, over-nutrition, genetic background, decreased hepatic insulin clearance, and fetal/metabolic programming may increase insulin secretion, thereby causing chronic hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is an important etiological factor in the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent data suggests that the onset of prediabetes and diabetes are preceded by a variable period of hyperinsulinemia. Emerging data suggest that chromic hyperinsulinemia is also a driving force for increased activation of the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, leading to a state of \"functional hypercortisolism\". This \"functional hypercortisolism\" by antagonizing insulin actions may prevent hypoglycemia. It also disturbs energy balance by shifting energy fluxes away from muscles toward abdominal fat stores. Synergistic effects of hyperinsulinemia and \"functional hypercortisolism\" promote abdominal visceral obesity and insulin resistance which are core pathophysiological components of the metabolic syndrome. It is hypothesized that hyperinsulinemia-induced increased activation of the HPA axis plays an important etiological role in the development of the metabolic syndrome and its consequences. Numerous studies have demonstrated reversibility of hyperinsulinemia with lifestyle, surgical, and pharmaceutical-based therapies. Longitudinal studies should be performed to investigate whether strategies that reduce hyperinsulinemia at an early stage are successfully in preventing increased activation of the HPA axis and the metabolic syndrome."

Large evidence leads to consider it as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, regardless of age, sex, smoking habit, cholesterolemia, and other elements of MS. Therapeutic strategies remain still unclear, but lifestyle modifications (diet, physical exercise, and weight loss) determine an improvement in IR, MS, and both clinical and histologic liver picture. NAFLD and IR are bidirectionally correlated and, consequently, the development of pre-diabetes and diabetes is the most direct consequence at the extrahepatic level. In turn, type 2 diabetes is a well-known risk factor for multiorgan damage, including an involvement of cardiovascular system, kidney and peripheral nervous system. The increased MS incidence worldwide, above all due to changes in diet and lifestyle, is associated with an equally significant increase in NAFLD, with a subsequent rise in both morbidity and mortality due to both metabolic, hepatic and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the slowdown in the increase of the \"bad company\" constituted by MS and NAFLD, with all the consequent direct and indirect costs, represents one of the main challenges for the National Health Systems."

It has become clear that, against a background of insulin resistance, obesity induces the so-called metabolic syndrome consisting of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, leading, consequently, to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in affected individuals. It is shown that environmental factors, e.g., high-fat diet and lack of physical activity, not only promote the onset of obesity but lead to impairment of the action of adiponectin and its receptors, thus accounting in part for the onset of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis in modern society. This review is intended to highlight some milestones in adipocyte research from the discovery of the insulin-sensitizing properties of adiponectin to the elucidation of the structures of its receptors, as well as to clarify their therapeutic implications and prospects for lifestyle-related diseases."

While the metabolic syndrome is directly responsible for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, additional impact on human pregnancy like preterm delivery with low-birth-weight infants as well as the development of diseases such as diabetes, preeclampsia and hypertension. Recent evidence suggests that MS is originated in fetal life in association with maternal nutrition during pregnancy and fetal programming which apparently increases the susceptibility for MS in children and later life. This review will describe the MS in association with the origin of the emerging diseases during pregnancy such as diabetes, preeclampsia and others. The influence of perinatal environment and maternal diet and smoking on MS as well as the genetic biomarkers of MS will be described."

Insulin resistance, a state of decreased biologic response to physiologic concentrations of insulin, is a key component of this syndrome and seems to be the result of a primary defect at the skeletal muscle glucose transporter. Acute illness and the perioperative period are characterized by a state of insulin resistance that manifests as hyperglycemia and leads to various other metabolic and biochemical alterations that adversely affect end organ function. Hyperglycemia in acutely ill patients adversely affects outcome. Achieving euglycemia seems beneficial in certain clinical situations, but considerable disagreement exists regarding the target blood sugar levels, the duration of therapy, and the modality. Pharmacotherapy, exercise, and nutrition to improve insulin sensitivity seem promising but require further evaluation to confirm their efficacy for perioperative risk reduction. This review discusses the pathophysiology and the clinical implications of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in the acutely ill patient with an emphasis on perioperative modulation strategies."

This is largely due to American's poor dietary patterns and practices causing increasing trends in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For decades, dietary guidelines on 'healthy diets' to reduce CVD risk, grounded in epidemiological research, have been nationally distributed to Americans. In this review, we highlight landmark events in modern nutrition science and how these have framed past and current understandings of diet and health. We also follow the evolution of dietary recommendations for Americans throughout the years, with an emphasis on recommendations aimed to reduce risk for CVD and mortality. Secondly, we examine how the low-fat ideology came to dominate America in the last decades of the 20th century and subsequently contributed to an excess intake of refined carbohydrates which, in the context of an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, may have fueled the obesity epidemic. We then examine the current major evidence-based dietary patterns and specific dietary approaches to reduce CVD risk, reviewing the literature surrounding nutritional components of the heart-healthy diet and discussing the dietary patterns proven most effective for CVD prevention: the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the Mediterranean diet, and the healthy vegetarian diet. Finally, we discuss emerging dietary trends, considerations for nutrition counseling, and future directions within the important field of nutrition, with the ultimate goal of improving vascular health."

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Literature search was carried out using the terms obesity, insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, nutrition, physical activity, and developing countries, from PubMed from 1966 to June 2008 and from web sites and published documents of the World Health Organization and Food and Agricultural Organization. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: With improvement in economic situation in developing countries, increasing prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome is seen in adults and particularly in children. The main causes are increasing urbanization, nutrition transition, and reduced physical activity. Furthermore, aggressive community nutrition intervention programs for undernourished children may increase obesity. Some evidence suggests that widely prevalent perinatal undernutrition and childhood catch-up obesity may play a role in adult-onset metabolic syndrome and T2DM. The economic cost of obesity and related diseases in developing countries, having meager health budgets is enormous. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent increasing morbidity and mortality due to obesity-related T2DM and cardiovascular disease in developing countries, there is an urgent need to initiate large-scale community intervention programs focusing on increased physical activity and healthier food options, particularly for children. International health agencies and respective government should intensively focus on primordial and primary prevention programs for obesity and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries."

This review attempts to summarize the recent literature on metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, a standard definition of metabolic syndrome for the pediatric population is not available. Recently, the International Diabetes Federation has proposed a new set of criteria to define metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents aged 6-16 years. The relationships between obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome may be explained by the pattern of lipid partitioning. Fatty liver plays a central role in the insulin-resistant state in obese adolescents. Although insulin resistance has been proposed as the central factor leading to the abnormalities observed in metabolic syndrome, most definitions of metabolic syndrome use impaired fasting glucose as a marker. Nutrition impairment during both prenatal and early postnatal life can cause metabolic disturbances leading to insulin-resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. SUMMARY: Metabolic syndrome prevalence in children and adolescents is on the increase. Therefore, the emphasis in all studies and programs related to metabolic syndrome should be focused on prevention, early detection of metabolic risk factors and interventions that will have a significant impact on future adult health."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of conversational agents for lifestyle medicine, in particular for weight-related behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors. Little is known about the effectiveness and acceptability of and engagement with conversational and virtual agents as well as the applicability of these agents for metabolic syndrome risk factors such as an unhealthy dietary intake, physical inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to get a greater understanding of the virtual agents that have been developed for cardiometabolic risk factors and to review their effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted to review conversational agents for cardiometabolic risk factors, including chatbots and embodied avatars. RESULTS: A total of 50 studies were identified. Overall, chatbots and avatars appear to have the potential to improve weight-related behaviors such as dietary intake and physical activity. There were limited studies on hypertension and diabetes. Patients seemed interested in using chatbots and avatars for modifying cardiometabolic risk factors, and adherence was acceptable across the studies, except for studies of virtual agents for diabetes. However, there is a need for randomized controlled trials to confirm this finding. As there were only a few clinical trials, more research is needed to confirm whether conversational coaches may assist with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Conversational coaches may regulate cardiometabolic risk factors; however, quality trials are needed to expand the evidence base. A future chatbot could be tailored to metabolic syndrome specifically, targeting all the areas covered in the literature, which would be novel."

The introduction of fast-food chains and Westernized dietary habits providing meals with fast-food characteristics seems to be a marker of the increasing prevalence of obesity. The mechanisms involved are probably that the supply of foods is characterized by large portion sizes with a high energy density, and sugar-rich soft drinks. The high energy density of foods is partly brought about by a high dietary fat content, and it has been shown that even in a Chinese population the increase from about 15% to 20% in the proportion of calories from fat is sufficient to explain some weight gain in the population. In addition, fast food from major chains in most countries still contains unacceptably high levels of industrially produced trans fatty acids that have powerful biological effects, and contribute to type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. New evidence also suggests that a high intake of trans fat may produce abdominal obesity, an important factor in the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The optimal diet for the prevention of weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes is fat-reduced, without any industrially produced trans fatty acids, fibre-rich, high in low energy density carbohydrates (fruit, vegetables and whole grain products) and with a restricted intake of energy-containing drinks."

NAFLD has a global prevalence of almost 30%, while incidence is rising with increasing levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome. Nutrition plays a significant role in both the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to explore the associations between dietary, lifestyle and other risk factors and the risk for developing NAFLD. Dietary patterns, lifestyle behaviours, comorbidities, or a combination of any may contribute to either the progression or prevention of NAFLD. Having diabetes, hypertension, or having obesity might increase the progression of NAFLD if not well treated and controlled. Diet influences the progression of NAFLD; following a western diet or simply a high-fat diet may contribute to the worsening of NAFLD and further progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis in later stages. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet is the gold standard for both the treatment and prevention of NAFLD. Social behaviours, such as smoking, caffeine consumption and physical activity also play a role in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Nutrition contributes significantly to the prevention or treatment of NAFLD, since this disease can be managed by diet and physical activity. However, further studies are still needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action. Randomized control trials are also needed to confirm findings in observational studies."

Its role in energy homeostasis is well-known, including the regulation of hydrocarbons and lipids metabolism as well as the improvement of insulin resistance. It has been thought to be a key molecule in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, which are epidemiological targets for preventing cardiovascular disease. In addition to beneficial metabolic effects, adiponectin seems to have anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and vasoprotective actions. Furthermore, adiponectin affects signalling in myocardial cells and exerts beneficial actions on the heart after pressure overload and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The ability of adiponectin to reduce insulin resistance in conjunction with its antiinflammatory and cardioprotective properties makes this adipocytokine a promising therapeutic target. On clinical interest, agents that enhance endogenous adiponectin production or action have potential for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Management strategies that increase adiponectin levels include weight reduction, Mediterranean diet, thiazolidinediones, antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs. Current knowledge on the main actions of adiponectin and therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review."

There have been a number of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome but all center around the metabolic abnormalities of central obesity, hypertension, decreased high-density lipoproteins and elevated triglycerides with insulin resistance as the uniting physiologic factor. The importance of the metabolic syndrome is not just related to its high prevalence rate but also because it predicts the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now recognized to be the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, which along with its individual components - particularly diabetes and elevated triglycerides, are the major risk factors for the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. NASH may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. It is currently the third most common cause for liver transplantation and is projected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation in 2020. Weight loss (via diet or bariatric surgery) and vitamin E have recently been demonstrated to be effective treatments of NASH. Although these and other agents may prove to be effective treatments for NASH, the most effective therapeutic strategy would be early screening and intervention to prevent the development of insulin resistance and oxidative stress at a societal level."

            "abstract": "Obesity is associated to increased incidence and poorer prognosis in multiple cancers, contributing to up to 20% of cancer related deaths. These associations are mainly driven by metabolic and inflammatory changes in the adipose tissue during obesity, which disrupt the physiologic metabolic homeostasis. The association between obesity and hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well known. Importantly, the retrospective analysis of more than 1000 epidemiological studies have also shown the positive correlation between the excess of fatness with the risk of cancer. In addition, more important than weight, it is the dysfunctional adipose tissue the main driver of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and all cause of mortality and cancer deaths, which also explains why normal weight individuals may behave as \"metabolically unhealthy obese\" individuals. Adipocytes also have direct effects on tumor cells through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of adiponectin and upregulation of leptin in serum correlate with markers of chronic inflammation, and crown like structures (CLS) associated to the adipose tissue disfunction. Nevertheless, obesity is a preventable risk factor in cancer. Lifestyle interventions might contribute to reduce the adverse effects of obesity. Thus, Mediterranean diet interventional studies have been shown to reduce to circulation inflammatory factors, insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular function, with durable responses of up to 2 years in obese patients. Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil reduced the incidence of breast cancer compared with a control diet. Physical activity is another important lifestyle factor which may also contribute to reduced systemic biomarkers of metabolic syndrome associated to obesity. In this scenario, precision nutrition may provide complementary approaches to target the metabolic inflammation associated to \"unhealthy obesity\". Herein, we first describe the different types of adipose tissue -thermogenic active brown adipose tissue (BAT) versus the energy storing white adipose tissue (WAT). We then move on precision nutrition based strategies, by mean of natural extracts derived from plants and/or diet derived ingredients, which may be useful to normalize the metabolic inflammation associated to \"unhealthy obesity\". More specifically, we focus on two axis: (1) the activation of thermogenesis in BAT and browning of WAT; (2) and the potential of augmenting the oxidative capacity of muscles to dissipate energy. These strategies may be particularly relevant as complementary approaches to alleviate obesity associated effects on chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, angiogenesis and chemotherapy resistance in cancer. Finally, we summarize main studies where plant derived extracts, mainly, polyphenols and flavonoids, have been applied to increase the energy expenditure."

The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the association between MedDiet and MetS in a representative sample of the Athenian population in the early 1980s, when MetS had not been established as an entity yet. METHODS: In a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey of cardiovascular disease (CVD), 2,074 randomly selected adults were examined: 900 men and 1,174 women (age, 46.9 ± 14.9 years). MetS was defined according to criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III. A validated questionnaire concerning nutrition habits was administered, and MedDiet was assessed according to guidelines of the Division of Nutrition/Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School. RESULTS: Overall, 1,023 participants (49.3%) followed MedDiet (47.3% men, 52.0% women, P = .033) with similar rates across age groups (P = .337). MetS was diagnosed in 24.0% of those following MedDiet, compared with 27.9% of those not following it (P = .041). Participants with CVD or diabetes mellitus were less likely to follow MedDiet (43% vs 50%, P = .009). Multivariate analysis revealed that MedDiet is associated with a 20% reduction in MetS (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-0.98), after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, light physical activity, serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and γ-glutamyl transferase, diabetes mellitus, CVD, family history of hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that adherence to MedDiet may attenuate the prevalence of MetS and, consequently, the increasing burden of diabetes mellitus and CVD, especially in urban populations."

A plethora of literature data suggest the potential role of gut microbiota in interfering with the host metabolism, thus influencing several MetS risk factors. Perturbation of the gut microbiota's composition and activity, a condition known as dysbiosis, is involved in the etiopathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases. Recent studies have shown that some micro-organism-derived metabolites (including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate) induce subclinical inflammatory processes involved in MetS. Gut microbiota's taxonomic species or abundance are modified by many factors, including diet, lifestyle and medications. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the correlation between different dietary strategies and changes in gut microbiota metabolites. We mainly focus on the validity/inadequacy of specific dietary patterns to reduce inflammatory processes, including leaky gut and subsequent endotoxemia. We also describe the chance of probiotic supplementation to interact with the immune system and limit negative consequences associated with MetS."

As such, the theory is intuitive and has substantial experimental support. It has generally been opposed by health agencies because of concern that carbohydrate will be replaced by fat, particularly saturated fat, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease as dictated by the so-called diet-heart hypothesis. Here we summarize recent data showing that, in fact, substitution of fat for carbohydrate generally improves cardiovascular risk factors. Removing the barrier of concern about dietary fat makes carbohydrate restriction a reasonable, if not the preferred method for treating type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We emphasize the ability of low carbohydrate diets to improve glycemic control, hemoglobin A1C and to reduce medication. We review evidence that such diets are effective even in the absence of weight loss."

The prevalence of MS and its components, as defined by the Nation-al Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines, were evaluated in nationally representative samples of non-institutionalized civilian Koreans. This analysis is based on the 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which used a stratified multistage probability sampling design. The final study included 5,742 adults who had completed the necessary health examinations and met the diagnosis of MS. The prevalence of MS was 25.5% in men and 28.7% in women. Odds ratio for MS among men with a familial history of hypertension/stroke was higher than that among men who did not have this history. The OR for MS among women with a familial history of hypertension/stroke or diabetes was higher than that among women who had no familial history of these diseases. These results show that familial history of hypertension/stroke and diabetes was significantly related to the presence of MS in both young men and women."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperinsulinemia, obesity and related metabolic diseases are associated with prostate cancer development. Prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are at increased risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while pre-existing metabolic conditions may be exacerbated. PURPOSE: An integrative approach is used to describe the interactions between insulin, glucose metabolism, obesity and prostate cancer. The potential role of nutrition and exercise will also be examined. FINDINGS: Hyperinsulinemia is associated with prostate cancer development, progression and aggressiveness. Prostate cancer patients who undergo ADT are at risk of diabetes in survivorship. It is unclear whether this is a direct result of treatment or related to pre-existing metabolic features (e.g. hyperinsulinemia and obesity). Obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with prostate cancer development and poorer outcomes for cancer survivors, which may be driven by hyperinsulinemia, pro-inflammation, hyperleptinemia and/or hypoadiponectinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Independently evaluating changes in glucose metabolism near the time of prostate cancer diagnosis and during long-term ADT treatment is important to distinguish their unique contributions to the development of metabolic disturbances. Integrative approaches, including metabolic, clinical and body composition measures, are needed to understand the role of adiposity and insulin resistance in prostate cancer and to develop effective nutrition and exercise interventions to improve secondary diseases in survivorship."

Results from prospective and cross-sectional studies also point to an association between the metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Visceral obesity and insulin resistance are two important features of the metabolic syndrome that might explain renal injury. We reviewed the literature to examine whether treatment of the metabolic syndrome can favorably influence renal outcomes. Weight loss, regular exercise, and a low-calorie, low-fat diet are first-line treatments of the metabolic syndrome, yet few data are available to indicate that such lifestyle interventions can prevent or reverse renal damage. Similarly, results from few studies show little or no beneficial effect of blood pressure control, use of statins, fibrates, thiazolidinediones or metformin on renal parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome. The reasons for the lack of trials in this research field are also discussed. This Review identifies the need to improve understanding of the role of metabolic syndrome in chronic kidney disease, define consistent criteria for metabolic syndrome and perform clinical trials that analyze renal outcomes as primary end points."

Most cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable through healthy lifestyle modifications in diet and physical activity. This systematic umbrella review presents a comprehensive overview of the evidence about the associations between risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome with 13 food groups, including refined and whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish and fish products, eggs, dairy/milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meat, and unprocessed red and white meat. We present these relationships in per-serving and with high-versus-low comparisons. After doing a systematic search in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Epistemonikos (registered with PROSPERO: CRD42024547606), we screened 5074 references published until May 15, 2024, and included 67 articles. This included 46 meta-analyses on risk of type 2 diabetes with half a million participants, 17 meta-analyses on risk of metabolic syndrome, and 4 meta-analyses on risk of diabetes-related mortality. Based on quality assessments using AMSTAR-2, 25 of the 67 studies were classified as high-quality studies, 8 as moderate, 12 as low, and 22 as critically low quality. Our results showed that a high intake of whole grains was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (metaevidence: moderate) and metabolic syndrome (metaevidence: low), with a similar tendency also for a high intake of fruits and vegetables (metaevidence: moderate). In contrast, the high intakes of processed meat (metaevidence: high), red meat (metaevidence: moderate), and sugar-sweetened beverages (metaevidence: moderate) were associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. For the other food groups, the associations were generally neutral and not statistically significant. The heterogeneity was high for most food groups except fruits, indicating potential differences within each of the food groups in association with type 2 diabetes."

It is backed up by large cohorts in epidemiological studies worldwide and has been tested in various animal models. The root causes of programming link closely with maternal condition during pregnancy, and therefore the fetal environment. Suboptimal fetal environments due to poor or inadequate nutrition, infection, anemia, hypertension, inflammation, gestational diabetes or hypoxia in the mother expose the fetus to hormonal, growth factor, cytokine or adipokine cues. These in turn act to alter metabolic, immune system, vascular, hemodynamics, renal, growth and mitochondrial parameters respectively and most evidently in the later stages of life where they impact on the individual as poor glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and heart disease. These events are compounded by over-nutrition or lifestyle choices which are in conflict with the programming of the fetus. We and others have utilised various species to test the early life programming hypothesis and to identify key molecular mechanisms. With parallel studies of human cohorts, these molecular markers can be validated as realistic targets for intervention."

Throughout the years, various weaning modes have come in succession, the latest being baby-led weaning; the timing for introducing foods and the requirements of which sort of nutrient for weaning have also changed over time. Furthermore, the role played by nutrition, especially in the early stages of life, for the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as diabetes, obesity or coeliac disease has also been increasingly highlighted.Members of Italian Society of Gastroenterology, Hepathology and Pediatric Nutrition (SIGENP) and the Italian Society of Allergology and Pediatric Immunology (SIAIP) Emilia Romagna here propose a practical approach for pediatricians to deal with daily practice. The four main areas for discussion were weaning in relation with the onset of allergic diseases, coeliac disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the nutrition requirements to take into account for assessing the diet of infants under one year of age and about the practice of baby-led weaning focusing on limits and benefits, respectively."

METHODS: Data were analyzed from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for normal plasma glucose [<100 mg/dl, n=4589]; impaired fasting glucose [IFG, 100-125 mg/dl, n=2008], diabetes [fasting glucose #10878; 126 mg/dl or diabetes medication, n=750]; and participants with and without the metabolic syndrome, n=1938 and n=5409, respectively. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, race, sex, body mass index, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, a higher odds (p-trend < 0.01) of the metabolic syndrome, an elevated HOMA-insulin resistance index, chronic kidney disease, elevated C-reactive protein, high fibrinogen, and high white blood cell count was observed across diabetes status. After similar adjustment, the metabolic syndrome was associated with (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval) low apolipoprotein A1 (2.27: 1.30,3.96), high apolipoprotein-B (2.97: 2.03,4.34), a higher HOMA insulin resistance index (5.25: 4.16, 6.63), chronic kidney disease (2.27: 1.42, 3.63), and elevated markers of inflammation [high white blood cell count (1.55: 1.14, 2.10), and elevated C-reactive protein (1.46: 1.06, 2.00)]. Among participants with IFG, the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was associated with a higher prevalence of the HOMA insulin reistance index, 32.3%, high fibrinogen, 18.5%, and elevated C-reactive protein, 13.2%, compared to persons with IFG alone, 19.7%, 13.3% and 5.7%, respectively (each p <== 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this representative of the US population, an increased prevalence of non-traditional CVD risk factors was present among persons with diabetes, IGT and IFG compared to IFG alone, and the metabolic syndrome."

A systematic review was conducted to answer five CQs formulated using the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) criteria. Twenty articles published between September 2013 and July 2016 were included, adding to the 37 articles from the previous review. There is a high level of evidence showing that MedDiet adherence plays a role in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and improves health in overweight and obese patients. There is moderate-to-high evidence that the MedDiet prevents increases in weight and waist circumference in non-obese individuals, and improves metabolic syndrome (MetS) and reduces its incidence. Finally, there is moderate evidence that the MedDiet plays primary and secondary roles in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The MedDiet is effective in preventing obesity and MetS in healthy and at-risk individuals, in reducing mortality risk in overweight or obese individuals, in decreasing the incidence of T2DM and CVD in healthy individuals, and in reducing symptom severity in individuals with T2DM or CVD."

Blood pressure and anthropometric characteristics of each participant were recorded. Food frequency questionnaires were evaluated using an 11-item score to determine the adherence to Mediterranean diet. RESULTS: Totally, 55.4% of participants had a good adherence to Mediterranean diet. The risk of metabolic syndrome in women was significantly higher than in men (OR=8.65, CI 95%=2.88-25.99; p<0.001). Nuts, legumes and seeds consumption were associated with a significant lower risk of metabolic syndrome (OR=0.42, CI 95%=0.188-0.917; p<0.05). No considerable association was observed between metabolic syndrome and adherence to Mediterranean diet (p=0.167). CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated no association between Mediterranean diet adherence and metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. However, nuts, legumes and seeds might have greater benefits for diabetics."

Thus, metabolic syndrome qualifies unequivocally as a medical condition in which there are, simultaneously, several independent metabolic risk factors, namely, abdominal obesity, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol level, arterial hypertension, and high glycemic level. Although age, sex, socio-economic status, and the precise definition of metabolic syndrome all influence the prevalence and risk of developing the condition, clinical and epidemiological studies clearly show that central obesity, as measured by an increased abdominal circumference, is the main risk factor. Thus, due to the growing global incidence of obesity, there has been an increase in the incidence of metabolic syndrome. Starting with obesity, all other metabolic risk factors are influenced: for example, as a result of insulin resistance with hyperglycemia, diabetes is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to increased abdominal circumference. Through this review, we aimed to highlight the latest research studies and dietary nutritional interventions useful in the prevention of this disease but also implementation strategies for primary prevention among the healthy population."

Most authorities have viewed elevated uric acid as a secondary phenomenon that is either innocuous or perhaps even beneficial, since uric acid can be an antioxidant. However, recent experiments have challenged this viewpoint. In this paper we argue that uric acid is a true risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, we suggest that the recent increased intake in the American diet of fructose, which is a known cause of hyperuricemia, may be contributing to the current epidemic of obesity and diabetes."

On the contrary, a simplified way of eating healthily by excluding highly-processed foods, is presumed to be the Paleolithic diet (a diet based on vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat, organ meats) which improves insulin resistance, ameliorates dyslipidemia, reduces hypertension and may reduce the risk of age-related diseases. The diet is the foundation of the treatment of obesity- and type 2 diabetes-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and a diet similar to those of pre-agricultural societies may be an effective option. To lend sufficient credence to this type of diet, well-designed studies are needed."

RECENT FINDINGS: Metabolic syndrome is a pro-inflammatory condition characterized by the coexistence of risk factors such as atherogenic dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes etc. related with increased risk of developing chronic diseases. In recent years, chemerin and asprosin, the new players of metabolic syndrome, whose incidence has been increasing with the changing world, have attracted attention as predictive biomarkers in metabolic syndrome. These two adipokines seem to mediate the systemic pro-inflammatory state of individuals with metabolic syndrome. There is information that chemerin and asprosin levels are mostly increased in individuals with metabolic syndrome and that their levels can be altered or unaffected by dietary and lifestyle factors. However, conflicting results in the literature indicate that more studies are needed. With the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits through healthy diet and exercise interventions, chemerin and asprosin hold promise for early detection, prevention and treatment strategies of metabolic syndrome."

Modern Chinese find themselves increasingly afflicted with the same noncommunicable chronic diseases typical of industrialized nations. Today, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of both morbidity and mortality, affecting both rural and urban Chinese. The rising incidence of cardiovascular disease has been fueled by an epidemic of cardiometabolic risk factors. While hypertension and smoking have received considerable spotlight, little attention has been given to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Their increasing prevalence is the focus of this paper."

Although the concept of the MetS is subject to debate due to lack of a unifying underlying mechanism, the prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype is rapidly increasing worldwide. Moreover, it is increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents of obese mothers. Evidence from both epidemiological and experimental animal studies now demonstrates that MetS onset is increasingly likely following exposure to suboptimal nutrition during critical periods of development, as observed in maternal obesity. Thus, the developmental priming of the MetS provides a common origin for this multifactorial disorder. Consequently, the mechanisms leading to this developmental priming have recently been the subject of intensive investigation. This review discusses recent data regarding the epigenetic modifications resulting from nutrition during early development that mediate persistent changes in the expression of key metabolic genes and contribute toward an adult metabolic syndrome phenotype. In addition, this review considers the role of the endogenous molecular circadian clock system, which has the potential to act at the interface between nutrient sensing and epigenetic processing. A continued and greater understanding of these mechanisms will eventually aid in the identification of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, and help develop therapeutic interventions, in accordance with current global government strategy."

In the last few decades, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the Western world has reached epidemic proportions and this is likely due to alterations in diet and the environment as well as decreased physical activity. This review discusses how the Western diet and lifestyle (Westernization) has played an important etiological role in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and its consequences by exerting negative effects on activity of the insulin-insulin-like growth factor-I (insulin-IGF-I) system. It is further proposed that interventions that normalize/reduce activity of the insulin-IGF-I system may play a key role in the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome. For successful prevention, limitation, and treatment of the metabolic syndrome, the focus should be primarily on changing our diets and lifestyle in accordance with our genetic make-up, formed in adaptation to Paleolithic diets and lifestyles during a period of several million years of human evolution. Translating this insight into clinical practice, however, requires not only individual changes in our food and lifestyle, starting in pediatric populations at a very young age, but also requires fundamental changes in our current health systems and food industry. Change is needed: primary prevention of the metabolic syndrome should be made a political priority. New strategies and policies should be developed to stimulate and implement behaviors encouraging the sustainable use of healthy diets and lifestyles to prevent the metabolic syndrome before it develops."

An imbalance in glucolipid metabolism is a major cause of metabolic syndrome, which has consequences for human health. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a member of the innate immune pattern recognition receptor family, is involved in inflammation-related disorders, autoimmune diseases, and tumors. Recent research has shown that TLR4 plays a key role in glucolipid metabolism, which is linked to insulin resistance, intestinal flora, and the development of chronic inflammation. TLR4 activation regulates glucolipid metabolism and contributes to the dynamic relationship between innate immunity and nutrition-related disorders. Further, TLR4 regulates glucolipid metabolism by controlling glycolysis and pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, interfering with insulin signaling, regulating adipogenic gene expression levels, influencing preadipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, and altering the intestinal microbiota and permeability. TLR4 functions may provide new therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this review is to enrich mechanistic research of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other nutrition-related disorders by summarizing the role of TLR4 in the regulation of glucolipid metabolism as well as its physiological mechanisms."

Therefore, this study investigated the effect of dietary and physical activities counseling on components of metabolic syndrome in school-age children with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial on children aged 6-12 years (<i>n</i> = 60) that was conducted with metabolic syndrome. The participants were divided into three groups, the intervention group (including dietary counseling, physical activity counseling, and diet and physical activity counseling group) and a control group. The data collection method in this study was based on interviews with parents and completing a physical activity and nutrition questionnaire appropriate to the group, measuring blood pressure, blood sugar, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and anthropometric indicators including height, waist, and weight. The intervention was carried out for 4 months. Data analysis was performed using SPSS<sub>21</sub>. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of abdominal obesity, hypertension, fasting blood sugar, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides in the three experimental groups (diet, physical activity, diet, and physical activity) and the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, counseling on diet and physical activity program execution is an essential base for controlling components of metabolic syndrome in children."

            "abstract": "Although the classical cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., smoking and hypertension) are becoming more effectively managed, a continuous increase of the so-called \"cardiometabolic risk\" is noted. Starting from this century, the nomenclature \"metabolic syndrome\" has become more popular to identify a cluster of disorders including obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance. It is a primary risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in both genders. Interestingly, the metabolic diseases display a distinct gender disparity with an apparent \"female advantage\" in the premenopausal women compared with age-matched men. However, women usually lose such \"sex protection\" following menopause or affliction of metabolic syndrome especially insulin resistance. A controversy exists in the medical literature concerning whether metabolic syndrome is a real syndrome or simply a cluster of risk factors. Several scenarios are speculated to contribute to the gender dimorphism in the cardiovascular sequelae in patients with metabolic syndrome including sex hormones, intrinsic organ function, and the risk factor profile (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and atherogenic diet). With the alarming rise of obesity prevalence, heart problems in metabolic syndrome continue to rise with a distinct gender dimorphism. Although female hearts seem to better tolerate the stress insults compared with the male counterparts, the female sex hormones such as estrogen can interact with certain risk factors to precipitate myopathic changes in the hearts. This synthetic review of recent literature suggests a role of gender disparity in myopathic factors and risk attributable to each metabolic component in the different prevalence of metabolic syndrome."

Metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. New knowledge of medical and nutraceutical intervention in the early stages of metabolic syndrome is central to prevent these deadly complications. People who eat chili pepper on a regular basis seem to stay healthier and live longer than those who do not. Animal experiments suggest a therapeutic potential for dietary capsaicin, the active principle in hot chili pepper, to reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. This is an attractive theory since capsaicin has been a culinary staple for thousands of years, and is generally deemed safe when consumed in hedonically acceptable doses. The broad expression of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in metabolically active tissues lends experimental support to this theory. This review critically evaluates the available experimental and clinical evidence for and against dietary capsaicin being an effective dietary means to improve cardio-metabolic health. It comes to the conclusion that although a chili pepper-rich diet is associated with a reduced risk of dying due to cardiovascular disease, dietary capsaicin has no clear effect on blood glucose or lipid profiles. Therefore, the reduced mortality risk may reflect the beneficial action of digested capsaicin on gut microbiota."

The beneficial effects of foods containing antioxidant polyphenols, intestinal microbiota control, and physical activity were also considered. We comprehensively examined a large body of published articles involving basic, animal, and human studie, as well as recent guidelines. As a result, dietary polyphenols from natural plant-based antioxidants and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, along with physical exercise, are promising complementary therapies to delay or prevent the onset of metabolic syndrome and counteract diabesity and cardiovascular diseases, as well as to protect against neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive decline. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota reduces the risks associated with MS, improves diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and exerts neuroprotective action. Despite several studies, the estimation of dietary polyphenol intake is inconclusive and requires further evidence. Lifestyle interventions involving physical activity and reduced calorie intake can improve metabolic outcomes."

Poor diet and low exercise can not explain many facets of the epidemic including the onset in children 6 month of age, the protective effect of obesity on the incidence of type 1 diabetes and the epidemic of type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome in grass fed horses. Poor diet and exercise also do not explain the epidemic of type 1 diabetes in children that resembles the epidemic of type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Several papers have been published to indicate that the epidemics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome in children are linked and are polar opposite responses to iatrogenic inflammation. Several lines of research support this. Data from different races indicates that there is an inverse relationship between developing type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Races with high risk of developing type 2 diabetes have a decreased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Data from Italy confirmed an inverse association between obesity and type 1 diabetes. Further studies indicate the inverse relationship between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes/obesity is due to cortisol production. Data indicates those with low cortisol responses have a predilection for type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders following inflammation, while those with high cortisol/ immune suppressive responses develop type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome/obesity which resembles a Cushingoid state but are spared in the autoimmune disorders. Japanese children produce much more cortisol following immunization than Caucasian children. The later explains why discontinuation of BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease in type 1 diabetes in European children and a decrease in type 2 diabetes in Japanese children. Both the epidemics of type 1 diabetes and metabolic syndrome correlate with an increase in immunization. Finally, there is a strong mechanism data that macrophage produced interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which are released following inflammation, causing destruction of insulin secreting islet cells and increase cortisol release, and thus have the ability to cause both type 1 and type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome (which resembles a Cushingoid state). The propensity to develop type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome depends on the propensity to release of cortisol which correlates with race."

Diet and dietary patterns are significant factors in the development and management of MetS. The associations between dietary patterns (i.e., high-carbohydrate [HCHO], high-fat [HF], and high-protein [HP] diets) and the prevalence of MetS in Koreans were examined using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, collected between 2018 and 2020. The study included data from 9069 participants (3777 men and 5292 women). The percentage of participants with MetS was significantly higher in the HCHO diet group than in the normal diet group in women. Women with HCHO diet were positively associated with elevated blood pressure and triglyceride levels based on a comparison with the normal diet group (<i>p</i> = 0.032 and <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively). Men with an HF diet were negatively associated with elevated fasting glucose levels based on a comparison with the normal diet group (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Our findings showed that HCHO intake was strongly associated with a higher risk of MetS, especially elevated blood pressure and triglyceride levels in women, and an HF diet was negatively associated with elevated fasting glucose levels in men. Further prospective studies of the impact of dietary carbohydrate, fat, and protein proportions on metabolic health are needed. The optimal types and proportions of these dietary components, as well as the underlying mechanisms through which suboptimal proportions can lead to MetS, should also be investigated."

A less sedentary life style seems at least as important as regular exercise. Exercise can probably be tailored to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and extent of bone loss. To ensure adherence, it is important to increase slowly the frequency, duration and intensity of exercise, and to find activities that suit the individual.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize, by performing a systematic review, current standards, recommendations, guidelines, and regulations (hereafter, referred to as documents) on the nutrition of children up to three years of age. Special emphasis was placed on long-term effects of early nutrition, such as the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or glucose intolerance. METHODS: MEDLINE, selected databases, and websites were searched for documents published between 2008 and January 2013. RESULTS: Forty two documents met the inclusion criteria. The strongest and most consistent evidence for a protective, long-term effect was documented for breastfeeding. Also, limiting the intake of sodium and rapidly absorbed carbohydrates, use of a specific meal pattern, reducing the consumption of saturated fatty acids by replacing them with polyunsaturated fatty acids, and lowering the intake of trans fatty acids, seems beneficial. Many documents did not evaluate long-term outcomes of interest to us, or reported insufficient or imprecise data. Inconsistency in recommendations for some outcomes and research gaps were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may serve as a helpful tool in planning further research, preventive actions against important diet-related diseases, and guidelines improvement."

These particular cardiovascular risk factors commonly occur together in obese individuals as components of the metabolic syndrome. In Asia, there is a trend toward an increase in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Abdominal adiposity is arguably the key factor underlying the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. It is now known that adipose tissues secrete adipokines, and in obese subjects, there is a chronic low-grade inflammation. The inflammation and the associated endothelial dysfunction are reversible in the early stages. The Asian diet is low in animal fat but high in carbohydrates. Recent studies suggest that low-carbohydrate diets are more effective than low fat diets in inducing weight loss, suggesting that excessive carbohydrate rather than fat is the cause of obesity. Strategies to combat cardiovascular disease should now focus on tackling the epidemic of obesity and developing innovative and effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions."

Methods and Results We analyzed prospective data from 5809 women with prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline from the Women's Health Initiative. Diet quality was defined using alternate Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension, Paleolithic, and American Diabetes Association dietary pattern scores calculated from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazard regression was used to analyze the risk of incident CVD. During mean 12.4 years of follow-up, 1454 (25%) incident CVD cases were documented. Women with higher alternate Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension, and American Diabetes Association dietary pattern scores had a lower risk of CVD compared with women with lower scores (Q5 v Q1) (hazard ratio [HR]<sub>aMed</sub> 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.93; HR<sub>DASH</sub> 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.83; HR<sub>ADA</sub> 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86). No association was observed between the Paleolithic score and CVD risk. Conclusions Dietary patterns that emphasize higher intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts/seeds, legumes, a high unsaturated:saturated fat ratio, and lower intake of red and processed meats, added sugars, and sodium are associated with lower CVD risk in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Disruption of the state of homeostasis among the gut microbiota has been shown to be causally linked to the development of host metabolic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular, diabetes, and fatty liver disease. This disruption is often referred to as gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis leads to altered metabolic products derived from the microbiota and these in turn, typically shift the homeostatic metabolic balance of the host towards a low-grade chronic inflammation, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome. The primary objective of this review is to examine and discuss some very current research that has been done to study the effect of bacterial metabolites on host metabolism, sometimes referred to as microbiota-host co-metabolism. The metabolic conditions reviewed here include obesity, a known risk factor for all of the other metabolic conditions, as well as, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

However, in 2005, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes jointly stated that no existing definition of the metabolic syndrome meets the criteria of a syndrome, and there have been endless debates on the pros and cons of using the concept of this syndrome. The controversy may stem from confusion between the syndrome and obesity. Obesity is an epidemic, essentially contagious disease caused by an environment of excess nutritional energy and reinforced by deeply rooted social norms. The epidemic of obesity should be prevented or controlled by social and political means, similar to the approaches now being taken to combat global warming. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is useless for this public purpose. The purpose of establishing criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome is to find individuals who are at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and who require specific therapy including diet and exercise. The syndrome may be an adipose tissue disease different from obesity; in that case, it would be characterized by inflammation clinically detected through systemic inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and insulin resistance reflecting histological changes in adipose tissue. However, many problems in defining the optimal diagnostic criteria remain unresolved."

These surrogate factors were fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and uric acid. METHODS: Waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, hsCRP, and uric acid measurements were obtained from 2,624 adolescent (12-18 years old) participants of the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We identified children with metabolic syndrome as defined by six commonly used sets of pediatric metabolic syndrome criteria. We then defined elevations in the surrogate factors as values in the top 5% for the cohort and calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each set of metabolic syndrome criteria and for each surrogate factor. RESULTS: Current pediatric metabolic syndrome criteria exhibited variable sensitivity and specificity for surrogate predictions. Metabolic syndrome criteria had the highest sensitivity for predicting fasting insulin (40-70%), followed by uric acid (31-54%), hsCRP (13-31%), and HbA1c (7-21%). The criteria of de Ferranti (which includes children with WC >75(th) percentile, compared to all other sets including children with WC >90(th) percentile) exhibited the highest sensitivity for predicting each of the surrogates, with only modest decrease in specificity compared to the other sets of criteria. However, the de Ferranti criteria also exhibited the lowest PPV values. Conversely, the pediatric International Diabetes Federation criteria exhibited the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric metabolic syndrome criteria exhibit moderate sensitivity for detecting elevations in surrogate factors associated with metabolic syndrome and with risk for future disease. Inclusion of children with more modestly elevated WC improved sensitivity."

Recent evidence indicates a role for oxidation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease, and endothelial dysfunction (exacerbated by factors such as dyslipidemia) may be the mediator of this relationship.

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The goal of this review is to explore the potential mechanisms behind the observed phenomenon of sexual dimorphism in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among vegetarians. To date, research has primarily focused on the association between vegetarian diets and CVD risk factors and events. However, few publications have explored gender differences in the point estimates of risk of CVD in vegetarians. Current data suggest that following a vegetarian diet is associated with a larger CVD risk reduction in males. RECENT FINDINGS: Although not a completely novel observation, recent systematic reviews have reported sexual dimorphism in CVD outcomes among vegetarians. Data regarding other conditions of which metabolic dysfunction is a fundamental component, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes, provide insight into potential mechanisms that may explain differences in CVD risk among male and female vegetarians. Evidence from observational studies suggests that a vegetarian diet is cardioprotective for both men and women. Differences in the point estimates of relative risk of major CVD outcomes for both genders when compared with their respective omnivorous counterparts raise the question of whether or not the benefits may be attenuated in women and whether this difference may be due to a combination of several behavioral and biological factors. Differences in dietary intake patterns and hormonal shifts which affect inflammation, body fat distribution, and metabolic syndrome risk have adverse effects on women as they age. Clinical trials comparing CVD outcomes in men and women who follow a vegetarian diet are needed to confirm the observed dimorphism in cohort studies and to elucidate the potential mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon. Currently, studies assessing the impact of other cardioprotective dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet, indicate that there may be a physiological basis for the divergent outcomes of men and women who are given the same dietary intervention. Further research investigating the dietary habits of males and females, as well as other potential confounding lifestyle factors, is needed."

This study aimed to review the current evidences available in relation to adverse effects of fast food pattern on cardiometa-bolic risk factors. METHODS: Relevant articles including epidemiological and clinical studies with appropriate design and good quality were obtained through searches of the Medline, PubMed, Scopus databases and Google scholar with related key words including \"fast foods\", \"processed foods\", \"obesity\", \"overweight\", \"insulin resistance\", \"diabetes\", \"cardiovascular disease\", \"metabolic syndrome\", \"dyslipidemia\" and \"hypertension\". RESULTS: Fast food consumption and out-of-home eating behavior is a main risk factor for lower diet quality, higher calorie and fat intake and lower micronutrients density of diet. Frequent consumption of fast foods was accompanied with overweight and abdominal fat gain, impaired insulin and glucose homeostasis, lipid and lipoprotein disorders, induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Higher fast food consumption also increases the risk of developmental diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: This review provides further evidence warning us against the irreparable effects of fast food consumption on public health especially the increasing global burden of obesity and cardiovascu-lar diseases."

Barriers to the medical care in this patient population include diminished adherence to treatment and preventative recommendations, lack of willingness to engage in self-care activities, decreased access to affordable medical care, underestimation of risk by physicians, and adverse effects of commonly prescribed psychiatric medications. When managing patients with mental illness it is necessary to estimate the patient's metabolic and cardiovascular risk, monitor BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and lipid profile regularly, evaluate psychiatric medications metabolic risk, and choose less \"metabolically threatening\" drugs. The promotion of healthy lifestyle choices among persons with serious mental illness is essential not only as part of their recovery, but as an integral part of preventing metabolic changes and weight gain linked to their illness and medication side effects. In patients with mental illness and co-morbid diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, psychiatrist and primary care clinicians should collaborate to establish a plan for healthy lifestyle habits (diet and activity regimen), encourage weight loss, and follow-up regularly using multispecialty teams to improve management."

Despite numerous treatment options, diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease with severe comorbidities, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, as well as cardiovascular disease. Therefore, animal models predictive of the efficacy and safety of novel compounds in humans are of great value to address the unmet need for improved therapeutics. Although rodent models provide important mechanistic insights, their predictive value for therapeutic outcomes in humans is limited. In recent years, the pig has gained importance for biomedical research because of its close similarity to human anatomy, physiology, size, and, in contrast to non-human primates, better ethical acceptance. In this review, anatomic, biochemical, physiological, and morphologic aspects relevant to diabetes research will be compared between different animal species, that is, mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and non-human primates. The value of the pig as a model organism for diabetes research will be highlighted, and (dis)advantages of the currently available approaches for the generation of pig models exhibiting characteristics of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus will be discussed."

This paper also deals with that issue; its aim includes an extensive analysis of the influence of the ketogenic diet on the prophylaxis and treatment of diabetes. The paper has been prepared based on a wide, meticulous analysis of the available literature on the subject. Among other findings, a favorable effect of that nutrition model has been demonstrated on the values of glycated hemoglobin, glucose, insulin, or other metabolic parameters in diabetes patients. The effect of the ketogenic diet on the pharmacotherapy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been presented and compared with the standard nutritional management plan recommended for that disease. Further research is needed in this field, especially studies with a long follow-up period. The discussed articles report interesting therapeutic advantages to the ketogenic diet in comparison with standard diets."

Metabolic syndrome is driven by an unhealthy lifestyle encompassing a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet as well as psychological distress, which potentially triggers these metabolic derailments. Various mind-body practices, such as postures, breathing, meditation, and relaxation, are included in yoga. Studies suggest that even one yoga session can improve cognitive function, oxygen saturation, baroreflex sensitivity, sympathovagal balance, and the body's ability to recover from stressful stimuli. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the stress attenuation effect of a combined approach of yoga and diet intervention among metabolic syndrome patients. METHODOLOGY: In this study we randomized 200 subjects diagnosed with metabolic syndrome as per the Joint interim statement 2009 into control and combined (yoga+diet) groups according to their intervention which was given for 6 months. Anthropometric, physiological, perceived stress score and biochemical parameters were collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: The study's findings show that, at three and six months from baseline, the combined yoga with diet approach significantly reduced metabolic risk factors (waist circumference, SBP, DBP, fasting blood glucose, and triglycerides) and improved HDL. At three and six months following the combined (yoga+diet) intervention, the perceived stress score also showed a substantial reduction. CONCLUSION: Combined (yoga+diet) interventions are effective in lowering the risk of metabolic syndrome and perceived stress."

            "abstract": "Diet and nutrition have played an important role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Recent literature emphasizes potential therapeutic effects of micronutrients found in natural products, indicating positive applications for controlling the pathogenesis of chronic diseases driven by an inflammatory nidus. Nutritional compounds which display anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects have specific applications in preventing oxidative stress induced injury which characterizes their pathogenesis. Patient control over diet and disease has been demonstrated in diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, rheumatology, carcinogenesis and other diseases. Polyphenolic compounds are ubiquitous dietary components, mainly flavonoids and tannins. Specific polyphenols are effective in scavenging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species. They are able to modulate genes associated with metabolism, stress defence, drug metabolizing enzymes, detoxification and transporter proteins. Their overall effect is protective in overcoming damaging effects of chronic diseases and in delaying the degenerative effects of ageing. The mechanisms involved in radical scavenging activity are complex, determined by the structure of the compound, redox status of the environment and interactions with other agents. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia associated with a pro-inflammatory pro-thrombotic state in metabolic syndrome and related risk of fatty liver, arthritis, neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancers are ideal therapeutic targets for bioactive phytochemicals which can combat oxidative stress induced damage at a sub-cellular level. It is relevant that purified micronutrients isolated from natural products may be less effective than a combination seen in the natural product due to synergistic effects of interacting agents. Some of these mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets are discussed."

In particular, there is a growing knowledge of the role that gene transcription factors play in the inflammatory process. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes represent multifactorial conditions resulting from improper balances of hormones and gene expression. In addition, these conditions have a strong inflammatory component that can potentially be impacted by the diet. It can reduce pro-inflammatory eicosanoids that can alter hormonal signaling cascades to the modulation of the innate immune system and gene transcription factors. Working knowledge of the impact of how nutrients, especially dietary fatty acids and polyphenols, can impact these various molecular targets makes it possible to develop a general outline of an anti-inflammatory diet that offers a unique, nonpharmacological approach in treating obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Several important bioactive dietary components can exert their effect through selected inflammatory pathways that can affect metabolic and genetic changes. In fact, dietary components that can modulate glucose and insulin levels, as well as any other mediator that can activate nuclear factor-kB, can also trigger inflammation through common pathway master switches."

We hypothesized that chlorogenic acid would improve cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic responses in a rat model of metabolic syndrome induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old, 335 ± 2 g, n = 48) were divided into 4 groups and fed with corn starch diet (16 weeks); corn starch diet with chlorogenic acid in food for the last 8 weeks; high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (16 weeks); or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with chlorogenic acid (~100 mg/kg/d) in food for the last 8 weeks. In high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats, chlorogenic acid reduced energy intake and food efficiency to reduce visceral fat, especially retroperitoneal fat, and abdominal circumference; reversed the elevated systolic blood pressure; and attenuated left ventricular diastolic stiffness with reduced collagen deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the left ventricle. Chlorogenic acid decreased inflammation and fat deposition in the liver along with reduced plasma liver enzyme activities of obese rats but did not change the plasma lipid profile. Chlorogenic acid increased diversity of gut microbiota, which may improve overall metabolism in the body. Thus, chronic dietary chlorogenic acid attenuated diet-induced inflammation as well as cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic changes, suggesting that chlorogenic acid has potential for further clinical evaluation."

METHODS: We used the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008, which is the national representative database. We classified the KNHANES subjects based on MS and glucose tolerance status, and compared clinical characteristics and future CVD risk among the subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 796 of the 4314 subjects were diagnosed with MS. Their clinical characteristics were significantly different from patients without MS. Prevalence of DM was 9.5% in subjects with MS, but only 1.1% in subjects without MS. In addition, there was no MS in 30.9% of total DM patients who were enrolled in this study. For the normal and impaired fasting glucose subgroups, the prevalence of moderate (5-10%) and high (>10%) CVD risk was significantly higher in patients with MS than in patients without MS (p < 0.001). However, in the DM subgroup, even after multiple adjustments, there were no differences in clinical characteristics or in the prevalence of moderate to high CVD risk according to MS status. That said, LDL cholesterol in the DM group without MS was significantly higher than in the DM group with MS (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of MS as a screening tool for high CVD risk may be limited in DM patients, and conventional risk factors such as LDL may be more important."

This review summarizes the current scientific evidence from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials on the relation between the MedDiet and T2DM and MetS and the possible mechanisms underlying the reported associations. A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed that greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of diabetes. The MedDiet has also been found to be beneficial in the prevention of gestational diabetes. Four large prospective studies have observed inverse associations between the MedDiet and MetS or its components. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of the MedDiet on T2DM and MetS. Results from the landmark PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) nutrition intervention trial showed that participants assigned to the MedDiet had a significant 30% reduction in the risk of T2DM and that it also promoted the reversion of MetS and its components, hyperglycemia and central obesity. In addition, 5 RCTs showed the beneficial effects of the MedDiet compared with other dietary patterns on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that, compared with a variety of control diets, the MedDiet was associated with beneficial effects on all MetS components. Bioactive components of the MedDiet synergize to affect various metabolic pathways, leading to a reduced cardiometabolic disease risk. The abundance of healthy, nutrient-dense foods that make up the plant-based MedDiet predicts its bioactivity and potential to beneficially influence metabolic pathways that lead to MetS and T2DM, as well as other chronic conditions. Abundant epidemiologic and clinical trial evidence supports the role of the MedDiet on the prevention and management of T2DM and MetS."

            "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a rising disease entity characterized by a clustering of metabolic conditions. Although prevalence of obesity as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) is relatively low in Asia compared to western countries, metabolic syndrome is growing into a significant public health problem. Comparative studies indicate that metabolic responses to obesity may be greater in South and East Asians than their western counterparts at given Body Mass Indexes (BMIs). Higher percentage body fat in Asians at given BMIs and over-responsiveness to obesity may in part explain the phenomenon for which the underlying causes are not clear. Furthermore, aborigines may be at an even greater MS risk. The metabolic syndrome definition itself as well as whether it should be defined are controversial. The National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) gives equal weight to each component disorder, while the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) takes central obesity as a pre-requisite. Both criteria adopt ethnic-specific cut-off points for waist circumference. Asian data favour the new NCEP-ATP III definition, as individuals that were selected through the NCEP criteria but disregarded by the IDF criteria had similar Framingham cardiovascular disease risk scores to those picked by both definitions. Prospective data show that the metabolic syndrome not only increases the risk of coronary artery disease but also cerebrovascular disease in Asians. Macronutrient composition and the quality of the diet are associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome. More research is needed to relate diet and metabolic syndrome in Asians."

            "abstract": "Obesity and Type 2 diabetes are now major public health issues in developed nations and have reached epidemic proportions in many developing nations, as well as disadvantaged groups in developed countries, e.g., Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and Australian Aborigines. These groups all show hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which have been demonstrated to be future predictors of Type 2 diabetes and have also been suggested as key factors in the etiology of the Metabolic Syndrome. It is now increasingly recognized that Type 2 diabetes is part of a cluster of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors comprising the Metabolic Syndrome. This group is at very high risk of atherosclerosis because each of the risk factors in the Metabolic Syndrome cluster in its own right is an important CVD risk factor. They also contribute cumulatively to atherosclerosis. A key strategy in reducing macrovascular disease lies in the better understanding of the Metabolic Syndrome--glucose intolerance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and central obesity. Although it has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance is the central etiological factor for the Metabolic Syndrome, epidemiological data do not support the idea that this can account for all of the cluster abnormalities. We have animal and human data suggesting that hyperleptinemia rather than, or synergistically with, hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the genesis of the CVD risk factor cluster that constitutes the syndrome. Studies in Psammomys obesus (the Israeli sand rat) suggest hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance is an early metabolic lesion in the development of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. This animal also develops other features of the Metabolic Syndrome, making it an excellent model to investigate etiology. Psammomys, when placed on an ad libitum laboratory diet, develops hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It also develops hyperleptinemia and leptin insensitivity, and hyperleptinemia is correlated with insulin resistance independent of changes in body weight. It is likely that a similar sequence occurs in the transition from the prediabetic state to Type 2 diabetes in humans. More recently, other potential players in the etiology of the Metabolic Syndrome have been suggested including endothelial dysfunction and acetylation-stimulating protein (ASP). It has been suggested that endothelial dysfunction may be an antecedent for both Type 2 diabetes and the Metabolic Syndrome. In addition, ASP is a serious new candidate for an important role in insulin resistance. The ASP pathway plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism and storage, and it has been suggested that ineffective storage of fatty acids by adipocytes due to a defect in the ASP pathway may lead to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes."

The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome itself appears to be an important risk factor for atherogenic cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and there is recent evidence that its components cluster, rather than occurring together by coincidence. A recent statement from the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute slightly modifies and clarifies the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome that are most widely used in the United States, along with giving practical guidance about management. Prompt therapeutic attention to the underlying risk factors--abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, and atherogenic/diabetogenic diet--is warranted for all patients with the metabolic syndrome, and drug therapy for specific metabolic risk factors should be considered for those at high or moderately high 10-year absolute risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A new class of investigational drugs that block cannabinoid type 1 receptors have shown promise. This review also discusses issues that require additional research and new drugs that are considered promising for treatment of the metabolic syndrome itself."

            "abstract": "Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as \"civilization diseases\", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases."

We wanted to find out what the current research on this topic was and what the effect of the gut microbiota on energy metabolism is, as well the effects of diet on the microbiome and what effect the microbiome has on metabolic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is thought to be due to greater calorie intake than expenditure. Recently, research has looked into the effects of the microbiome on obesity. Our gut flora is made up of trillions of microbes and there is evidence to suggest that even from the earliest stages of life, altering that flora can affect human's ability to gain and lose weight, which can lead to obesity and ultimately other disease such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and liver disease. Obesity can affect the human body in profound ways and lead to a multitude of comorbidities. We found that the obesity pandemic appears to parallel the increased use of antibiotics seen across the US. In addition, the use of antibiotics can alter the gut flora even from the earliest stages of life and the altered microbiome can alter our body habitus and energy metabolism through antibiotics, diet, and bariatric surgery."

The risk of developing specific components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood sugar has been largely attributed to environmental stressors including poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and smoking. However, large epidemiologic cohorts and experimental animal models support the \"developmental origins of adult disease\" hypothesis, which posits that a significant portion of the risk for adult metabolic conditions is determined by exposures occurring in the perinatal period. Maternal obesity and the rate of complications during pregnancy such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes continue to rise. As our ability to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality improves the long-term metabolic consequences remain uncertain, pointing to the need for further research in this area."

Human long-term follow-up studies on the same topic are few. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the risk of overweight and the metabolic syndrome in adult offspring of women with diet-treated gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or type 1 diabetes, and additionally to study associations between estimates of maternal hyperglycemia and outcome in the offspring. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a follow-up study of 1066 primarily Caucasian women aged 18-27 yr in the Center for Pregnant Women with Diabetes, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: Offspring of women with diet-treated GDM (n = 168) and an unexposed reference group (n = 141) participated, as well as offspring of women with type 1 diabetes (n = 160) and offspring from the background population representing an unexposed reference group (n = 128). The follow-up rate was 56% (597 of 1066). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women with body mass index of at least 25 kg/m(2) were considered overweight. The metabolic syndrome was determined by the International Diabetes Federation 2006 criteria. RESULTS: The risk of overweight was doubled in offspring of women with diet-treated GDM or type 1 diabetes compared with offspring from the background population, whereas the risk of the metabolic syndrome was 4- and 2.5-fold increased, respectively. Offspring risk of the metabolic syndrome increased significantly with increasing maternal fasting blood glucose as well as 2-h blood glucose (during oral glucose tolerance test). CONCLUSIONS: Adult offspring of women with diet-treated GDM or type 1 diabetes are risk groups for overweight and the metabolic syndrome. Intrauterine hyperglycemia may in addition to genetics and other factors contribute to the pathogenesis of overweight and the metabolic syndrome."

The diverse clinical characteristics illustrate the complexity of the disease, involving several dysregulated metabolic pathways and multiple genetic targets. The increasing prevalence of obesity heightens the requirement to reduce the risk of the metabolic syndrome. In order to understand the aetiology, it is critical to appreciate the nature of multiple gene-gene and gene-nutrient interactions relevant to the metabolic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Research indicates a major role for genetic susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome. Nutrition clearly plays an important role in the development and progression of the condition. Genetic background can interact with habitual dietary fat composition, thereby affecting predisposition to the metabolic syndrome, and may also determine an individual's responsiveness to altered dietary fat intake. These studies indicate that therapeutic dietary therapy may require a 'personalized nutrition' approach, wherein a particular genetic profile may determine responsiveness of patients to specific dietary fatty acid interventions. SUMMARY: Understanding the biological impact of gene-nutrient interactions will provide a key insight into the pathogenesis and progression of diet-related polygenic disorders. This review explores the hypothesis that genetic components of the metabolic syndrome may be modified by dietary fatty acid composition."

            "abstract": "Thirty percent of the world population is diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. High-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (Western diet) correlates with metabolic syndrome prevalence. We characterized effects of the HF/HS diet on vascular (arterial stiffness, vasoreactivity, and coronary collateral development) and cardiac (echocardiography) function, oxidative stress, and inflammation in a rat model of metabolic syndrome (JCR rats). Furthermore, we determined whether male versus female animals were affected differentially by the Western diet. Cardiovascular function in JCR male rats was impaired versus normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. HF/HS diet compromised cardiovascular (dys)function in JCR but not SD male rats. In contrast, cardiovascular function was minimally impaired in JCR female rats on normal chow. However, cardiovascular function in JCR female rats on the HF/HS diet deteriorated to levels comparable to JCR male rats on the HF/HS diet. Similarly, oxidative stress was markedly increased in male but not female JCR rats on normal chow but was equally exacerbated by the HF/HS diet in male and female JCR rats. These results indicate that the Western diet enhances oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction in metabolic syndrome and eliminates the protective effect of female sex on cardiovascular function, implying that both males and females with metabolic syndrome are at equal risk for cardiovascular disease.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Western diet abolished protective effect of sex against cardiovascular disease (CVD) development in premenopausal animals with metabolic syndrome. Western diet accelerates progression of CVD in male and female animals with preexisting metabolic syndrome but not normal animals. Exacerbation of baseline oxidative stress correlates with accelerated progression of CVD in metabolic syndrome animals on Western diet."

Its treatment involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. In this review the authors focus on foods with potential benefits for this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Metabolic syndrome is associated with the risk of diabetes, and thus cardiovascular disease. In recent years, many scientific studies have evaluated the role of different foods and diets in the treatment of the components of metabolic syndrome, especially atherogenic dyslipidemia. SUMMARY: It is imperative to identify strategies that favorably impact this deadly syndrome. Here the authors review how different nutrients in food can modify metabolic syndrome, potentially altering its natural history, and related consequences. Although there is no \"all-inclusive\" diet yet, it seems plausible that a Mediterranean-style diet exhibits most of the desired attributes."

The anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic properties of EPA and DHA supplementation have been well-described. However, there is still a significant lack of information about their particular mechanism of action. Furthermore, repeated meta-analyses have not shown conclusive results in support of their beneficial health effects. Modern \"omics\" approaches, namely proteomics and lipidomics, have made it possible to identify some of the mechanisms behind the benefits of marine lipids in the metabolic syndrome and related diseases, i.e., cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Although until now their use has been scarce, these \"omics\" have brought new insights in this area of nutrition research. The purpose of the present review is to comprehensively show the research articles currently available in the literature which have specifically applied proteomics, lipidomics or both approaches to investigate the role of marine lipids intake in the prevention or palliation of these chronic pathologies related to diet. The methodology adopted, the class of marine lipids examined, the diet-related disease studied, and the main findings obtained in each investigation will be reviewed."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The metabolic syndrome, a cluster of disorders often including abdominal obesity, is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Insulin resistance is a key feature of the metabolic syndrome. Observational studies have indicated that the type of fat in the diet may be related to the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, also independent of possible effects on body weight. Dietary surveys are often imprecise. One way to monitor the type of fat in the diet is to record the fatty acid composition in plasma. This review summarizes recent data on the relationships between fatty acid composition in plasma and insulin resistance, diabetes and other disorders related to the metabolic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Insulin resistance and insulin resistant states are often associated with the fatty acid pattern in plasma, characterized by an increased proportion of palmitic (16 : 0) and a low proportion of linoleic (18 : 2 n-6) acids, with a distribution of other fatty acids indicating an increased activity of delta-9 and delta-6 desaturase. This shows that there may be a causal relationship between the type of fat in the diet and insulin action, an assumption supported by recent dietary intervention studies. SUMMARY: In a public health perspective these results, from both observational and intervention studies, underline the importance of fat quality in the diet for the development of a number of prevalent diseases. Taken together with several earlier studies and recent epidemiological findings, they give strong support to present dietary guidelines."

METHODS: There is a relationship between genetic indicators, fat mass accumulation, body composition and Mediterranean diet. The evaluation of nutrition treatment or interventions together with the genetic state; provides to manage or prevent the development of chronic diseases. RESULTS: As a result of nutrigenetic studies; specific nutrition factors in Mediterranean Diet have positive effects on gene expressions related to obesity. In the future, the rapidly-developing nutrition science and the optimal nutrition model special for individuals might play an important role in terms of health development and healing. CONCLUSION: This metanalysis aimed to explain the current status and relationship between metabolic syndrome indicators that are related to obesity and the gene-nutrient interactions within the Mediterranean Diet."

The evidence is considered that heart-rate variability (HRV) (the time differences between one beat and the next) can be used to indicate the potential health benefits of food items. Reduced HRV is associated with the development of numerous conditions for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, obesity and psychiatric disorders. Although more systematic research is required, various aspects of diet have been shown to benefit HRV acutely and in the longer term. Examples include a Mediterranean diet, omega-3 fatty acids, B-vitamins, probiotics, polyphenols and weight loss. Aspects of diet that are viewed as undesirable, for example high intakes of saturated or trans-fat and high glycaemic carbohydrates, have been found to reduce HRV. It is argued that the consistent relationship between HRV, health and morbidity supports the view that HRV has the potential to become a widely used biomarker when considering the influence of diet on mental and physical health."

The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study, a Spanish multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), was designed to assess the long-term effects of the MD, without any energy restriction, on the incidence of CVD in individuals at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Since its inception, it gave a great contribution to the available literature on the issue. It is well known that, in the field of the health sciences, RCTs provide the best scientific evidence. Thus, the aim of the present review is to analyse the results of the RCTs performed within the frame of the PREDIMED study.

            "abstract": "Reducing food intake in lower animals such as the rat decreases body weight, retards many aging processes, delays the onset of most diseases of old age, and prolongs life. A number of clinical trials of food restriction in healthy adult human subjects running over 2-15 years show significant reductions in body weight, blood cholesterol, blood glucose, and blood pressure, which are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Lifestyle interventions that lower energy balance by reducing body weight such as physical exercise can also delay the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In general, clinical trials are suggesting that diets high in calories or fat along with overweight are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and dementia. There is a growing literature indicating that specific dietary constituents are able to influence the development of age-related diseases, including certain fats (trans fatty acids, saturated, and polyunsaturated fats) and cholesterol for cardiovascular disease, glycemic index and fiber for diabetes, fruits and vegetables for cardiovascular disease, and calcium and vitamin D for osteoporosis and bone fracture. In addition, there are dietary compounds from different functional foods, herbs, and neutraceuticals such as ginseng, nuts, grains, and polyphenols that may affect the development of age-related diseases. Long-term prospective clinical trials will be needed to confirm these diet-disease relationships. On the basis of current research, the best diet to delay age-related disease onset is one low in calories and saturated fat and high in wholegrain cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables, and which maintains a lean body weight. Such a diet should become a key component of healthy aging, delaying age-related diseases and perhaps intervening in the aging process itself. Furthermore, there are studies suggesting that nutrition in childhood and even in the fetus may influence the later development of aging diseases and lifespan."

However, a paucity of data exists on best practices for provision of nutrition, exercise and psychological support within the testicular cancer space, patients and caregivers, highlighting the urgent need for additional work in this field.

Atherosclerosis kills more diabetic patients than all other causes combined. Multiple risk factors tend to cluster in some patients in a syndrome termed insulin resistance syndrome or \"Syndrome X.\" Increasing evidence has changed the recommended management of diabetes from simple glucose control to aggressive lipid management and control of the other components of the metabolic syndrome to prevent development of cardiovascular disease. One mechanism linking hyperglycemia and atherogenesis is nonenzymatic glycation of proteins. Hyperglycemia increases the linkage of glucose to proteins producing insoluble complexes, termed advanced glycation end products, that cause endothelial cell changes. Glycation of lipoproteins increases their atherogenic potential. It is not clear whether intensive glucose control in diabetic patients significantly lowers the rate of long-term macrovascular complications, and glucose control by itself may not be sufficient to prevent cardiovascular disease. Elevated triglyceride levels in diabetic patients are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Though LDL-cholesterol levels are not necessarily elevated in type 2 diabetes, higher levels (or LDL phenotype B) are shown to be more atherogenic. The association between obesity and hypertension is well documented, and obesity can worsen other risk factors. Glycemic control may not always normalize lipid and lipoprotein levels, particularly in type 2 diabetes. Trials of intensive glycemic control have not shown a significant reduction in coronary events despite significant decreases in microvascular complications. Medical nutrition therapy and exercise remain the cornerstone for nonpharmacologic treatment with a goal of improved insulin sensitivity."

This study aimed to examine the effects of a care intervention program on pregnancy outcome in pregnant women with Metabolic Syndrome during 2017-2018. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial study was conducted in 120 singleton pregnant women with metabolic syndrome. The participants were selected using purposive sampling method from pregnant women referred to two health centers of Babol. They were randomly divided in two control and intervention groups (60 samples in each group). Intervention group received one motivational interview session for 120 min, two consultation sessions with expert for nutritional recommendations based on Nutrition Guidelines of Ministry of Health for Pregnant Women. They were also theoretically and practically provided by three training sessions for physical activity and pregnancy exercises combining pelvic floor muscles, bodybuilding, muscle strengthening, stretching, and relaxation and walking activities. To follow up on the intervention, the researcher made a phone call with the participants in intervention group every 10 days to two weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The obtained results showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups in maternal complications including gestational diabetes, hospitalization due to gestational diabetes, nutritional diet for gestational diabetes, pregnancy weight gain and 2-hour post-prandial blood glucose test (<i>p</i> ≤ .01). There was no significant difference in terms of demographic, midwifery and metabolic syndrome indices between the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicated that intervention program improved the maternal pregnancy outcome such as gestational diabetes and weight gain during the pregnancy in the intervention group. This program had no adverse effects for the mother who is consistent with pregnancy health objectives."

            "abstract": "Fructose consumption has been linked to manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MS); an emerging epidemic. The current study attempts to demonstrate fructose overconsumption-mediated cardiovascular disease (CVD) remodeling in Wistar rats. Rats were randomly segregated into control (CON) and high fructose diet (FFR) groups and received customized diets for 20 weeks. Levels of diabetic, lipid, antioxidant, markers, mRNA levels of inflammatory, apoptotic markers, and histopathological changes were assessed in excised hearts of both groups. Significant increase in uric acid, pro-oxidants diabetic, lipid, inflammatory markers, cytosolic cytochrome C, nuclear NF-кB-p65, and decrease in antioxidants was observed in FFR group. Abnormal myocardial architecture was observed in the FFR group along with elevated mRNA levels of inflammatory, apoptotic markers, and MMP-9, -2. The outcomes of the study are suggestive of role of aforementioned molecules in high fructose intake-mediated pathological deterioration of heart and development of MS-associated CVD progression. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Excessive fructose consumption in the form of high fructose corn syrup, sugary drinks, and commonly available fast foods has been shown to be linked with many diseases such as liver malfunction, metabolic syndrome diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, delineated pathways and clear mechanisms and their role in cardiovascular remodeling due to excessive fructose consumption are yet to be established. The present study establishes the deleterious effects of foods with high sugar content on progression toward metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular remodeling. It further investigates the role of different pathways involved in the development of high fructose-induced diet-induced metabolic syndrome, and thereby leading to harmful effects on the hearts of rats consuming high fructose diet leading to cardiovascular in Wistar rats. The study suggests the role of immunomodulation and oxidative stress in the remodeling of cardiac muscles and in turn progression toward metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular remodeling. The study, therefore, throws light on the deleterious effects of consumption of foods and easily available fast foods on progression toward numerous non-communicable diseases."

Approximately 80% of patients with metabolic syndrome have some degree of fatty liver disease. An adenosine derivative (IFC-305) has been shown to exert protective effects in models of liver damage as well as on elements involved in central metabolism; therefore, here, we evaluated the effect of IFC-305 in an experimental model of metabolic syndrome in rats induced by a high-fat diet and 10% sucrose in drinking water for 18 weeks. We also determined changes in fatty acid uptake in the Huh-7 cell line. In the experimental model, increases in body mass, serum triglycerides and proinflammatory cytokines were induced in rats, and the adenosine derivative significantly prevented these changes. Interestingly, IFC-305 prevented alterations in glucose and insulin tolerance, enabling the regulation of glucose levels in the same way as in the control group. Histologically, the alterations, including mitochondrial morphological changes, observed in response to the high-fat diet were prevented by administration of the adenosine derivative. This compound exerted protective effects against metabolic syndrome, likely due to its action in metabolic regulation, such as in the regulation of glucose blood levels and hepatocyte fatty acid uptake."

Nutritional factors are implicated in many oral and systemic diseases and conditions, including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, dental caries and some cancers including oral cancers. This review focuses on the evidence for the relations between key nutritional factors and health. Energy intake is related to body weight and obesity, highlighting the importance of lower-energy diets and regular physical activity for body weight maintenance and for preventing obesity. Evidence is presented for the health benefits of high quality carbohydrates, such as whole grain products, and fruits and vegetables, in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. The adverse effects of sugar, sweetened beverages, and trans and saturated fats on several diseases including caries, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are described. The health benefits of unsaturated fats, antioxidants, B vitamins and vitamin D in cardiovascular disease, periodontitis, cancer, and other conditions are documented. Both benefits and harmful effects of dairy product intake on health are discussed. Based on the evidence, nutritional guidelines are provided, as well as key recommendations for preventing obesity. Dentists can play a critical role in motivating and enabling healthy food choices."

This paper summarises epidemiology research results on the relationship between diet, nutrition and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) available in China. Most data used in this paper are from correlation studies. While the information is very useful in generating hypotheses on dietary and nutritional risk factors for CVD, both prospective studies and population-based intervention trials are needed to further verify these hypotheses. The information in this review clearly shows that diet and nutrition play important roles in the occurrence of CVD and hypertension in the Chinese population. Therefore, dietary means should be an important part of the strategies for the control of CVD and hypertension in China."

It is characterised by fat accumulation in the liver evolving to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an inflammatory subtype that can lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Currently, there is no effective pharmacotherapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Treatment is therefore based on lifestyle modifications including changes to diet and exercise, although it is unclear what the most effective form of intervention is. The aim of this review, then, is to discuss the role of specific nutrients and the effects of different dietary interventions on NAFLD. It is well established that an unhealthy diet rich in calories, sugars, and saturated fats and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibre, and micronutrients plays a critical role in the development and progression of this disease. However, few clinical trials have evaluated the effects of nutrition interventions on NAFLD. We, therefore, summarise what is currently known about the effects of macronutrients, foods, and dietary patterns on NAFLD prevention and treatment. Most current guidelines recommend low-calorie, plant-based diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, as the most effective dietary pattern to treat NAFLD. More clinical trials are required, however, to identify the best evidence-based dietary treatment approach."

METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study conducted on a sample of 2,359 patients without cardiovascular disease or diabetes, included in the cohort of the IBERICAN study. Using ANOVA models and adjusting for age, economic status, employment situation, level of education, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, tobacco use and alcohol consumption, we estimated the association of the variables blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood glucose and waist circumference with the self-reported level of physical activity (sedentary, moderate, high, very high). The analyses were performed stratifying by sex. RESULTS: A total of 854 men and 1,505 women with no identified diseases were included. Women were more sedentary than men (p<0.004; OR = 1,35; IC95% = 1,10-1,65) and presented lower values in all the components of the metabolic syndrome, except for HDL-cholesterol, which was higher (p<0.001). The adjusted ANOVA model shows that diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, and waist circumference were significantly lower the higher the level of physical activity in both men and women (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients served in primary care clinics without diabetes or cardiovascular disease and with high levels of physical activity showed better metabolic syndrome profiles. Given that women are more sedentary, gender approaches are needed in the promotion of physical activity to prevent metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease."

After adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, smoking status, cotinine concentration, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and vitamin or mineral use, participants with the metabolic syndrome had significantly lower concentrations of retinyl esters, vitamin C, and carotenoids, except lycopene. With additional adjustment for serum lipid concentrations, vitamin E concentrations were significantly lower in participants with the metabolic syndrome than those without the syndrome. Retinol concentrations were similar between the two groups. After excluding participants with diabetes, the results were very similar. Consumption of fruits and vegetables was also lower among people with the metabolic syndrome. Adults with the metabolic syndrome have suboptimal concentrations of several antioxidants, which may partially explain their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

A central theme in this review is that excessive hepatic activity of an archetypal protein kinase enzyme, \"atypical\" protein kinase C (aPKC), plays a critically important role in the development of impaired glucose metabolism, systemic insulin resistance, and excessive hepatic production of glucose, lipids and proinflammatory factors that underlie clinical problems of glucose intolerance, obesity, hepatosteatosis, hyperlipidemia, and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes. The review suggests that normally inherited genes, in particular, the aPKC isoforms, that were important for survival and longevity in times of food scarcity are now liabilities in times of over-nutrition. Fortunately, new knowledge of insulin signaling mechanisms and how an aberration of excessive hepatic aPKC activation is induced by over-nutrition puts us in a position to target this aberration by diet and/or by specific inhibitors of hepatic aPKC."

Metabolic syndrome is significantly influenced by the daily diet of patients. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, originally designed to prevent or control hypertension, offers additional metabolic benefits due to its nutrient composition. The DASH diet recommends the intake of potassium, magnesium, calcium and fibre while limiting total fat, saturated fat and sodium, which is beneficial for patients with MS. Due to its limited fat content and high levels of fibre and calcium, individuals following the DASH diet are less prone to being overweight and obese and have lower concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, the DASH diet can reduce blood pressure and is effective in correcting glucose and insulin abnormalities. This review comprehensively summarises the health benefits of the DASH diet on the risk factors of MS and describes the potential mechanisms based on available evidence."

The most frequent complications of these are the development of diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accurate tools are needed to classify the cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the MetS population. In recent years, numerous biomarkers of bone metabolism have been associated with CVR. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) in a cohort of patients with MetS and to analyse its association with MetS parameters and CVR as well as with T2D prevalence. A longitudinal study was conducted in which a MetS population was followed for one year. Weight change, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), ucOC levels, MetS parameters and CVR were analysed and CVR was calculated using different scores. Our results showed a decrease of CVR associated with a better adherence to the MetDiet resulting in higher HDL-C and ucOC levels though the improvement of MetS risk factors. This bone protein appeared as a potential biomarker to classify CVR in the MetS population, especially for MetS patients without prevalent T2D. Furthermore, ucOC serum levels could be good predictors of T2D prevalence."

Caloric balance is inherent to a good diet. Despite patients who say they eat little, ideal weight can be maintained if calories are burned. Composition is another component of a healthy diet. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets provide proof of CV benefit from their specific content. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is associated with poor diet and obesity. A healthy diet with good nutrition benefits the MS patient and associated conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Exercise, in conjunction with a healthy diet and good nutrition, helps maintain optimal weight and provides CV benefit such as decreased inflammation and increased vasodilatation. Whether vitamins or other nutritional supplements are important in a healthy diet is unproven. Nevertheless, the most promising data of added benefit to a healthy diet is with vitamin D. Some dietary supplements also have promise. Alcohol, in moderation, especially red wine, has nutritional and heart protective benefits. Antioxidants, endogenous or exogenous, have received increased interest and appear to play a favorable nutritional role. CV health starts with good nutrition."

Typically, these diseases are attributed to lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking. However, studies have now identified strong associations between patterns of growth during foetal and neonatal life and an increase predisposition towards developing heart disease, obesity and diabetes in adult life. While the connection between a mother's diet and the long-term health of her offspring has been studied in great detail, our understanding of whether offspring health might be affected by a father's diet remains limited. Greater insight into the impact that paternal nutrition has on sperm quality, epigenetic status and potential offspring programming mechanisms is needed to redress this parental-programming knowledge imbalance. Disturbances in paternal reproductive epigenetic status represents one key mechanism linking paternal diet with the programing of offspring development and adult health, as many enzymatic processes involved in epigenetic regulation use metabolic intermediates to modify DNA and histones. Here, poor paternal nutrition could result in perturbed sperm and testicular epigenetic status, impacting on post-fertilisation gene transcriptional regulation and protein expression in offspring tissues, resulting in increased incidences of metabolic disorder in adult life."

Dietary patterns are well known to play a important role in our overall health and well-being, and therefore, poor diet and malnutrition are among the most critical risk factors for chronic disease. Thus, dietary recommendation and nutritional supplementation have significant clinical implications for the targeted treatment of some of these diseases. Multiple dietary patterns have been proposed to prevent chronic disease incidence, like Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DRRD). Among them, the MedDiet, which is one of the most well-known and studied dietary patterns in the world, has been related to a wide extent of health benefits. Substantial evidence has supported an important reverse association between higher compliance to MedDiet and the risk of chronic disease. Innovative strategies within the healthcare framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM) view personalized dietary customization as a predictive medical approach, cost-effective preventive measures, and the optimal dietary treatment tailored to the characteristics of patients with chronic diseases in primary and secondary care. Through a comprehensive collection and review of available evidence, this review summarizes health benefits of MedDiet in the context of PPPM/3PM for chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and cancer, thereby a working hypothesis that MedDiet can personalize the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases was derived."

Given the health promoting aspects of this diet, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS), which is the largest health study in Australia and the first nutrition-specific national-based study. The primary aim of this analysis was to determine the proportion of Australian adults adhering to the MD and to examine the association between adherence to the MD and markers of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Out of the 9435 participants included in the study (mean age = 48.6 ± 17.6 years), 65% were in the middle tertile of the MD score. Participants who were married, employed, of a high-socioeconomic level, nonsmokers, educated and had a healthy body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were more likely to have higher adherence levels to the MD, which was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, even after accounting for all possible confounders, higher adherence to the MD was associated with lower risk of dyslipidaemia, OR = 1.06 (1.01-1.10). In conclusion, this analysis is the first to assess adherence to the MD on a national level. Our results indicated that MD adherence may contribute to reducing the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, cerebrovascular disease and elevated blood pressure in a multi-ethnic, non-Mediterranean country."

            "abstract": "According to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, African Americans have a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome than do Whites. Recent reports in Blacks in other regions have confirmed these observations, but the rates vary. This lower rate of metabolic syndrome in Blacks can be partly ascribed to the lower prevalent rates of some major components of metabolic syndrome, namely serum triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in Blacks. This is in contrast with the higher prevalence of obesity (waist circumference) and blood pressure that meet National Cholesterol Education Program criteria in Blacks. Despite these seemingly favorable lipids and lipoprotein profiles, Blacks continue to have higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity, even in the absence of diabetes, than do Whites. Insulin resistance is more prevalent in Blacks than in Whites. However, the relationships among insulin resistance and CVD risk factors such as hypertension, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides are weak in contrast with Whites. The paradox of more favorable lipid profile and conversely the higher rates of unfavorable blood pressure in Blacks calls into question the validity of the current criteria for metabolic syndrome in Blacks. Thus, it can be argued that each of the components of the metabolic syndrome carry different CVD risk factors in Blacks. The greater CVD mortality and morbidity in Blacks appear to be multifactorial. With the emerging epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, chronic kidney diseases due to both diabetes and hypertension have emerged as major CVD risks that are associated with increasing mortality and morbidity in Blacks. We need to emphasize specific components of metabolic syndrome, specifically blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, that carry higher CVD risk with associated greater morbidity and mortality for primary prevention of CVD and type 2 diabetes in Blacks. To this end, we believe the higher prevalence of hypertension and chronic kidney diseases in Blacks suggests that the current classification, definition, and criteria for metabolic syndrome in Blacks should be reconsidered."

Although traditionally advice was focused on carbohydrate quantification, it is now clear that both the amount and type of carbohydrate are important in predicting an individual's glycemic response to a meal. Diets based on carbohydrate foods that are more slowly digested, absorbed, and metabolized (i.e., low glycemic index [GI] diets) have been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, whereas intervention studies have shown improvements in insulin sensitivity and glycated hemoglobin concentrations in people with diabetes following a low GI diet. Research also suggests that low GI diets may assist with weight management through effects on satiety and fuel partitioning. These findings, together with the fact that there are no demonstrated negative effects of a low GI diet, suggest that the GI should be an important consideration in the dietary management and prevention of diabetes."

When treating metabolic syndrome, lifestyle and diet are primary areas for interventions. A dietician-led grocery nutrition system scoring patients' purchases may correlate to better control of metabolic health. OBJECTIVE: To compare the number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome for patients with grocery nutrition scores at goal versus those below goal as pre-defined by the dietician team. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: This exploratory, retrospective cohort pilot study took place in a single pharmacy within a large community pharmacy chain in Northwest Ohio. PRACTICE INNOVATION: This retrospective cohort study compared the number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome between two groups: patients with a grocery nutrition score at a dietician-set goal and patients not at goal. EVALUATION METHODS: Data were collected from May 2022 to March 2023, with patients completing a questionnaire collecting information on demographics. In addition, the questionnaire, grocery nutrition scores, and patient medication records were collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic items. A number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome by patients at dietician-set grocery nutrition score goal and not at goal were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study. There was not a significant difference in a number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome between groups, with patients who had a grocery nutrition score at goal taking an average of 1.20 medications compared to 1.96 for those with grocery nutrition scores below goal. CONCLUSIONS: While no statistical difference in mean medication use was identified, grocery nutrition scores may help understand patients' dietary habits. Larger studies are required to test the relationship between grocery nutrition scores, patient-specific factors, and medications taken for metabolic syndrome."

Anti-insulin resistance diet is therefore a carbohydrate enriched, fat-reduced (lactovegetabile) nutrition with not too frequent meals (longer meal-free phases) and mainly reduced energy intake in overweight."

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an independent association between early menarche (<12 years) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Korean women. We analyzed data from 4463 premenopausal women from the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-IV (2007-2009). MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Federation for Asians and insulin resistance (IR) was defined as HOMA-IR more than 3.05. The prevalence of MetS and IR was 7.9 and 15.0%. Women (55.6%) with MetS also showed IR. The prevalence of MetS was higher in both women with early menarche and late menarche (≥16 years) compared with the reference group (early, 12.8%; reference, 7.0%; late, 11.0%, both P = 0.002). However, the odds ratio for MetS was 3.54 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.14-5.87) and for IR was 2.98 (95% CI, 1.99-4.47) after adjusting for age and other confounders such as lifestyle variables, reproductive variables and sociodemographic variables only in women with early menarche CONCLUSION: Early menarche was associated with an increased risk of MetS and IR in premenopausal Korean women. WHAT IS KNOWN: Early menarche is associated with higher risk of CVD-related death and all-cause mortality in Western studies. Early menarche is associated with higher risk of diabetes in Korean premenopausal women. WHAT IS NEW: Early menarche (<12 years) is associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in nationally representative Korean premenopausal women. However, late menarche (>16 years) is not associated with metabolic syndrome after controlling for age and other confounders."

In the last 15 years, a large volume of research has linked low birth weight to many adult diseases in humans, such as Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is a causal factor in all these conditions. There are epidemiological studies linking low birth weight to increased adiposity, but the timing of the insult during gestation seems crucial, as reducing maternal nutrition in late gestation and during lactation causes a reduction in later obesity. Recent studies in animal models have provided clues towards mechanisms of altered appetite regulation following alterations in fetal and neonatal growth. The outcome of these and future studies could prove clinically crucial, particularly in the debate over the benefits of breast feeding, which provides a lower plane of nutrition compared with formula feeding."

The age-adjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 18.8%+/-0.5% (men, 17.8%+/-0.8%; women, 20.5%+/-0.7%) using the NCEP definition and 19.5%+/-0.5% (men 15.0%+/-0.8%, women 23.9%+/-0.7%) using the IDF definition among participants 20 years or older. The agreement rate, which is the percentage of participants who were classified as either having or not having the metabolic syndrome by both definitions of the metabolic syndrome, was 84.6%+/-0.5% (kappa=0.54). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome using the NCEP definition was higher in participants with lower body mass index, whereas the prevalence using the IDF definition was higher in subjects with higher body mass index. The odds ratio (OR) for coronary artery disease was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-6.1) for participants with the metabolic syndrome defined by the NCEP definition, whereas it was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-5.0) for those with the metabolic syndrome defined by the IDF definition. Similarly, the OR for stroke was higher using the NCEP definition (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.7-5.2) compared with that of the IDF definition (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0). However, the CIs by both definitions overlapped considerably. In conclusion, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome using the IDF definition was higher than that using the NCEP definition, whereas the NCEP definition was more closely associated with cardiovascular disease in the Korean population."

METHODS: The study included 1284 patients who were hospitalized in a 28-month period due to acute or chronic ischaemic heart disease in hospitals across Croatia. An individual questionnaire was prepared which enabled recording of various cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Patients with chronic coronary artery disease have a better index of healthy diet than patients with acute coronary disease. Women have a better index of diet than men in both Croatian regions. When the prevalence of risk factors (impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus types I and II, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypertension) in patients with Mediterranean and continental nutrition is compared, a trend is seen for patients who have risk factors to consume healthier food. CONCLUSION: The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This effect is more evident in patients with known cardiovascular disease."

This study compared a DASH-like diet high in carbohydrates with similar diets high in protein and high in unsaturated fats. Measures of metabolic syndrome, except waist, and measures of risk factors for vascular diseases were taken at the end of each dietary period. All 3 diets significantly lowered the number of metabolic syndrome components (p ≤ 0.002) with a standardized measure of changes in metabolic syndrome components, suggesting that the high-protein, high-fat diet was most efficacious overall (p = 0.035). All 3 diets lowered a calculated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, with the high-protein and unsaturated fat diet being the most efficacious (p < 0.001). Only the unsaturated fat diet showed a slightly decreased calculated 9-year risk of diabetes (p = 0.11). Of the 3 weight-neutral diets, those high in protein and unsaturated fats appeared partially or wholly most beneficial."

The growing prevelance of metabolic syndrome seems to be an end result of our current lifestyle which promotes high caloric, high-fat foods and minimal physical activity, resulting in a state of positive energy balance. Increased adiposity and physical inactivity may represent the beginning of the appearance of these risk factors. Understanding the metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances associated with diet and exercise habits is a crucial step towards reducing the risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Although considerable research has been conducted linking chronic fructose ingestion to the increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome risk factors, these studies have mainly been performed on animals, and/or in a post-absorptive state. Further, the magnitude of the effect of fructose may depend on other aspects of the diet, including the total amount of carbohydrates and fats in the diet and the overall consumption of meals. Therefore, the overall aim of this review paper is to examine the effects of a diet high in fructose on postprandial lipidemia, inflammatory markers and glucose tolerance, all risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, an objective is to investigate whether increased physical activity can alter such effects."

It also represents a disorder of partial genetic background as mutations of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g). Thiazolidinedione agonists for the PPAR-g system are effective in control of insulin resistance and diabetes. Telmisartan has a molecular structure that imparts partial agonist properties with the PPAR-g molecule, which results in reductions in glucose and lipid metabolism. Administration of telmisartan to rats on a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet leads to reductions in glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels. The results imply that the ARB agent, telmisartan, could treat both the hemodynamic and metabolic aberrations seen in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hypertension."

METHODS: Data of 9791 men and women aged 20+ from 1998 and 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were individually linked to national hospitalisation and mortality data using unique personal identification numbers. During a 5.8-year follow-up through 2005, 288 incident cardiovascular events (184 strokes and 122 cases of ischaemic heart disease) and 85 new diabetes cases have been detected. RESULTS: Men and women with the metabolic syndrome had 48%, 39%, 64%, and 127% greater risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes, respectively, than those without the metabolic syndrome. The increased risks of cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes remained significant after adjusting for health behaviours, bio-clinical factors, family history, and socio-demographic factors. Analysis results on population attributable risks showed that about a quarter of total diabetes occurrence and more than 10% of cardiovascular disease was attributable to the metabolic syndrome. The number of metabolic syndrome components was linearly associated with risks of outcomes. High blood pressure was significantly associated with all four outcomes while hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia were also important for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of metabolic risk factors is necessary in South Korea to lower the burden of associated diseases, especially ever-increasing ischaemic heart disease and diabetes."

After multiple-adjustment, the hazard ratios for participants with the metabolic syndrome were 1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.85) for mortality from cardiovascular disease, 1.29 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.82) for mortality from coronary heart disease, 1.68 (95% CI: 0.86, 3.27) for mortality from stroke, 1.23 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.59) for mortality from diseases of the circulatory system, and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.45) for all-cause mortality compared with participants without the syndrome. The association between the number of metabolic syndrome criteria and mortality from cardiovascular disease was near linear (P = 0.007). Three criteria of the syndrome-excess weight, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration-were not independently associated with any of the outcomes. Additional prospective studies are needed to examine the association between the metabolic syndrome and the incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality from cardiovascular disease and all-causes."

This study has investigated the responses to rind of yellow mangosteen (<i>Garcinia dulcis</i>), usually discarded as waste, in a rat model of human metabolic syndrome. The rind contains higher concentrations of phytochemicals (such as garcinol, morelloflavone and citric acid) than the pulp. Male Wistar rats aged 8-9 weeks were fed either corn starch diet or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for 16 weeks, which were supplemented with 5% freeze-dried <i>G. dulcis</i> fruit rind powder during the last 8 weeks. We characterised metabolic, cardiovascular, liver and gut microbiota parameters. High-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats developed abdominal obesity, hypertension, increased left ventricular diastolic stiffness, decreased glucose tolerance, fatty liver and reduced <i>Bacteroidia</i> with increased <i>Clostridia</i> in the colonic microbiota. <i>G. dulcis</i> fruit rind powder attenuated these changes, improved cardiovascular and liver structure and function, and attenuated changes in colonic microbiota. <i>G. dulcis</i> fruit rind powder may be effective in metabolic syndrome by appetite suppression, inhibition of inflammatory processes and increased fat metabolism, possibly related to changes in the colonic microbiota. Hence, we propose the use of <i>G. dulcis</i> fruit rind as a functional food to ameliorate symptoms of metabolic syndrome."

Plasma adiponectin levels are decreased in obesity, which causes insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, we identified adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) as the therapeutic target. It was suggested that, similarly to caloric restriction and exercise, activation of the AdipoRs may have the potential not only to improve lifestyle-related diseases but to contribute to prolonged the shortened lifespan on a high caloric unhealthy diet. To this end, we have identified \"AdipoRon\" as an adiponectin receptor agonist. Indeed, AdipoRon ameliorated diabetes associated with obesity as well as to increase exercise endurance, thus prolonging shortened lifespan of obese mice fed on a high fat diet. Additionally, we have recently determined the crystal structures of the human AdipoRs. The seven-transmembrane helices of AdipoRs are structurally distinct from those of G-protein coupled receptors. It is expected that these findings will contribute not only to the elucidation of the AdipoR-related signal transduction but to the development and optimization of AdipoR-targeted therapeutics for obesity-related diseases such as diabetes."

Optimal nutrition can help boost immune function, maximize the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and contribute to a better overall quality of life. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, many people with HIV were dealing with wasting and opportunistic infections (OIs) linked to unsafe food or water. While these problems are less common today in developed countries with widespread access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), many HIV positive people have traded these concerns for worries about body shape changes, elevated blood lipids, and other metabolic complications associated with antiretroviral therapy. Fortunately, maintaining a healthy diet can help address these problems. As HIV positive people live longer thanks to effective treatment, good nutrition can also help prevent problems (such as bone loss) associated with normal aging. But there is no single, optimal eating regimen appropriate for every person living with HIV/AIDS. Instead, HIV positive people should adopt a sensible balanced diet and consult an experienced nutrition specialist for individualized recommendations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disease states that increases an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cardiovascular disease. When treating metabolic syndrome, lifestyle and diet are primary areas for interventions. A dietician-led grocery nutrition system scoring patients' purchases may correlate to better control of metabolic health. OBJECTIVE: To compare the number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome for patients with grocery nutrition scores at goal versus those below goal as pre-defined by the dietician team. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: This exploratory, retrospective cohort pilot study took place in a single pharmacy within a large community pharmacy chain in Northwest Ohio. PRACTICE INNOVATION: This retrospective cohort study compared the number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome between two groups: patients with a grocery nutrition score at a dietician-set goal and patients not at goal. EVALUATION METHODS: Data were collected from May 2022 to March 2023, with patients completing a questionnaire collecting information on demographics. In addition, the questionnaire, grocery nutrition scores, and patient medication records were collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic items. A number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome by patients at dietician-set grocery nutrition score goal and not at goal were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study. There was not a significant difference in a number of medications taken for metabolic syndrome between groups, with patients who had a grocery nutrition score at goal taking an average of 1.20 medications compared to 1.96 for those with grocery nutrition scores below goal. CONCLUSIONS: While no statistical difference in mean medication use was identified, grocery nutrition scores may help understand patients' dietary habits. Larger studies are required to test the relationship between grocery nutrition scores, patient-specific factors, and medications taken for metabolic syndrome."

METHODS: In 2001-2002, n = 1514 men and n = 1528 women (>18 years old) in Athens, Greece, free of cardiovascular disease were recruited. MetS was defined according to the revised NCEP ATP III (2005) or the IDF criteria or the harmonized criteria. The validated D-AII was calculated using a standardized procedure (range 10-77). RESULTS: Inverse associations were observed between D-AII and transition from healthy to unhealthy metabolic status (Odds Ratio (OR)<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.88 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI)(0.73, 0.98)) and diabetes (OR<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.55, 95%CI(0.29, 0.77)). In women, D-AII was inversely associated with transition from healthy to unhealthy metabolic status (OR<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.55, 95%CI(0.26, 0.90), diabetes (OR<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.41, 95%CI(0.18, 0.64) and hypertension (OR<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.75, 95%CI(0.20, 0.95), yet only with diabetes incidence in men (OR<sub>3rd vs. 1st tertile</sub> = 0.62, 95%CI(0.38, 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Diet with high anti-inflammatory load seems an effective preventive measure to retain a metabolically benign status, principally in terms of glycemic control."

The objective of the present narrative review was first to describe Nutri-Score and then to synthesize some of the international scientific evidence for its effectiveness. Guided by scientific data and collective expertise, France formally adopted labelling of pre-packaged food with the 5-colour Nutri-Score label in October 2017 and that move was later followed by Belgium, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. METHODS: This article synthesizes evidence from several countries regarding the effectiveness of Nutri-Score and the associated individual-level diet quality index in terms of attitude/behaviour- and health-related outcomes. It also addresses criticism levied at the label. RESULTS: The effectiveness of Nutri-Score has been demonstrated in terms of consumer ability to correctly classify food according to its nutritional quality, the nutritional quality of actual and intended food purchases, and portion size choices. In addition, consumption of foods that are less favourably rated on the Nutri-Score scale has been prospectively associated with chronic disease risk (cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, etc.). CONCLUSION: The adoption and implementation of a uniform front-of-package label such as the scientifically validated Nutri-Score on pre-packaged foods/beverages across Europe could be beneficial to consumers at the point of purchase and could help reduce the incidence of diet-related chronic diseases by means of improvement in diet quality."

Lifestyle modifications, especially dietary habits, are the main therapeutic strategy for the treatment and management of metabolic syndrome, but the most effective dietary pattern for its management has not been established. Specific dietary modifications, such as improving the quality of the foods or changing macronutrient distribution, showed beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome conditions and individual parameters. On comparing low-fat and restricted diets, the scientific evidence supports the use of the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention as the new paradigm for metabolic syndrome prevention and treatment. The nutritional distribution and quality of these healthy diets allows health professionals to provide easy-to-follow dietary advice without the need for restricted diets. Nonetheless, energy-restricted dietary patterns and improvements in physical activity are crucial to improve the metabolic disturbances observed in metabolic syndrome patients."

Given its protective effects in reducing oxidative and inflammatory processes of cells and avoiding DNA damages, cell proliferation, and their survival, angiogenesis, inflammations and metastasis, the Mediterranean diet is considered a powerful and manageable method to fight cancer incidence.

In this Review, we explore how geographical location affects the gut microbiome and how different diets shape its composition and function. We examine the mechanisms by which whole dietary regimes, such as the Mediterranean diet, high-fibre diet, plant-based diet, high-protein diet, ketogenic diet and Western diet, influence the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we underscore the need for exhaustive studies to better understand the causal relationship between diet, host and microorganisms for the development of precision nutrition and microbiome-based therapies."

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease affects ~37 million adults in the US, and it is often undiagnosed due to a lack of apparent symptoms in early stages. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) interferes with the body's physiological and biological mechanisms, such as fluid electrolyte and pH balance, blood pressure regulation, excretion of toxins and waste, vitamin D metabolism, and hormonal regulation. Many CKD patients are at risk of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, chronic metabolic acidosis, bone deterioration, blood pressure abnormalities, and edema. These risks may be minimized, and the disease's progression may be slowed through careful monitoring of protein, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and calcium, relieving symptoms experienced by CKD patients. In this review, the current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommendations are highlighted, reflecting the 2020 update, including explanations for the pathophysiology behind the recommendations. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, the Mediterranean diet, and the whole foods plant-based diet are currently being examined for their potential role in delaying CKD progression. Biological explanations for why the whole foods plant-based diet may benefit CKD patients compared to diets that include animal products are examined. Strong evidence continues to support the importance of diet meeting the daily requirement in the prevention and progression of kidney disease, and medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian is a critical aspect in medical intervention for CKD."

Such diets offer a broad spectrum of health benefits including aiding in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. In addition to health benefits, a plant-based diet may provide performance-enhancing effects for various types of exercise due to high carbohydrate levels and the high concentration of antioxidants and phytochemicals found in a plant-based diet. However, some plant-based foods also contain anti-nutrional factors, such as phytate and tannins, which decrease the bioavailability of key nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and protein. Thus, plant-based diets must be carefully planned to ensure adequate intake and absorption of energy and all essential nutrients. The current narrative review summarizes the current state of the research concerning the implications of a plant-based diet for health and exercise performance. It also outlines strategies to enhance the bioavailability of nutrients, sources of hard-to-get nutrients, and sport supplements that could interest plant-based athletes."

In addition to 2 major randomized secondary prevention trials (Lyon Heart and CORDIOPREV) and 1 primary prevention trial (PREDIMED) that have demonstrated these benefits, there is an unprecedented body of high-quality prospective epidemiological evidence supporting these beneficial effects. The key elements of this traditional pattern are the abundant use of extra-virgin olive oil and high consumption of foods of natural plant-based origin (fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes) and fish, along with a reduction in processed meats, red meats, and ultraprocessed products. Moderate consumption of wine, preferably red wine, with meals is an essential element of this traditional pattern. Although removing wine consumption from the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a reduction in its preventive efficacy, doubts have recently arisen about the possible adverse effect of even low or moderate intake of any alcoholic beverages. A new large Spanish trial, UNATI, which will begin in June 2024, will randomize 10 000 drinkers aged 50 to 75 years to abstention or moderate consumption. UNATI aims to answer these doubts with the best possible evidence."

DESIGN: A narrative review was applied at the country level to highlight the multiple sustainable benefits of the Mediterranean diet into a single multidimensional framework: the Med Diet 4.0. Setting/subjects We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that contained data on the characterization of sustainable diets and of the Mediterranean diet. The methodological framework approach was finalized through a series of meetings, workshops and conferences where the framework was presented, discussed and ultimately refined. RESULTS: The Med Diet 4.0 provides a conceptual multidimensional framework to characterize the Mediterranean diet as a sustainable diet model, by applying principles of sustainability to the Mediterranean diet. CONCLUSIONS: By providing a broader understanding of the many sustainable benefits of the Mediterranean diet, the Med Diet 4.0 can contribute to the revitalization of the Mediterranean diet by improving its current perception not only as a healthy diet but also a sustainable lifestyle model, with country-specific and culturally appropriate variations. It also takes into account the identity and diversity of food cultures and systems, expressed within the notion of the Mediterranean diet, across the Mediterranean region and in other parts of the world. Further multidisciplinary studies are needed for the assessment of the sustainability of the Mediterranean diet to include these new dimensions."

            "abstract": "Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that dietary factors may play a role in systemic low-grade chronic inflammation. Summary evidence from randomized controlled trials has shown substantial effects on biomarkers of inflammation following the adoption of plant-based diets (including, but not limited to, the Mediterranean diet), while consistent findings have been reported for higher intakes of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and positive trends observed for the consumption of legumes, pulses, nuts, and olive oil. Among animal food groups, dairy products have been shown to have the best benefits on biomarkers of inflammation, while red meat and egg have been shown to have neutral effects. The present review provides an overview of the mechanisms underlying the relation between dietary factors and immune system, with a focus on specific macronutrient and non-nutrient phytochemicals (polyphenols) and low-grade inflammation. Substantial differences within each macronutrient group may explain the conflicting results obtained regarding foods high in saturated fats and carbohydrates, underlying the role of specific subtypes of molecules (i.e., short-chain fatty acids or fiber vs. long chain fatty acids or free added sugars) when exploring the relation between diet and inflammation, as well as the importance of the food matrix and the commixture of foods in the context of whole dietary patterns. Dietary polyphenols and oligopeptides have been hypothesized to exert several functions, including the regulation of the inflammatory response and effects on the immune system. Overall, evidence suggests that dietary factors may affect the immune system regardless of obesity-related inflammation."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant-based diets are associated with multiple health benefits and a favorable environmental impact. For prostate cancer, previous studies suggest a beneficial role of specific plant-based foods (e.g., tomatoes) and a potentially harmful role of specific animal-based foods (e.g., meat, dairy). However, less is known about plant-based dietary patterns. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the relation between plant-based diet indices and prostate cancer risk, including clinically relevant disease. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including 47,239 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014). Overall and healthful plant-based diet indices were calculated from FFQs. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs to examine the risk of incident prostate cancer (total and by clinical category), among men ages <65 and ≥65 y. RESULTS: Of the 47,239 men, 6655 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer over follow-up, including 515 with advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, 956 with lethal disease (metastasis or death), and 806 prostate cancer deaths. Greater overall plant-based consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of fatal prostate cancer (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; P-trend = 0.04). In men aged <65, a higher plant-based diet index was associated with a lower risk of advanced, lethal, and fatal prostate cancer. Moreover, greater consumption of a healthful plant-based diet was associated with lower risks of total (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98; P-trend = 0.046) and lethal prostate cancer (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.94; P-trend = 0.03) at age <65. There were no associations between overall or healthful plant-based diet indices with prostate cancer among men ≥65 y. Fewer than 1% of participants followed a strict vegetarian or vegan diet. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study provides supportive evidence that greater consumption of healthful plant-based foods is associated with a lower risk of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, with stronger benefit among men aged <65 y."

A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic acid while α-linolenic acid is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic acid from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke. We review the important dietary role of cereal grains in prevention of coronary disease and stroke. Polyphenols from grapes, wine and alcoholic beverages are discussed, in particular their effects on coagulation. The mechanisms of action of probiotics and vitamins are also included."

This diet has been reported to cause changes in microbial composition, concentration levels of glycemic parameters, and immune cells or inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, as well as Mediterranean and plant-based dietary interventions, on gut microbiota composition and glucose homeostasis in individuals with PD or T2D. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines and checklist. PubMed, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar were the three databases that were used to search for electronically published studies. Data extraction was conducted and examined by the reviewers and all the eligible studies were selected. To test for the quality and biases of the included studies, the Downs and Black checklist was used, followed by the use of Review Manager 5.4. A forest plot was used for meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. The strength of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Overall, eight studies met the inclusion criteria: seven focused on patients with T2D, and one focused on patients with PD. The prebiotic dietary intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on glycemic control, including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). However, one study investigating the Mediterranean diet reported a significant effect on glycemic control. Both prebiotic and Mediterranean dietary interventions were found to beneficially influence gut microbial composition in the intervention groups compared to the placebo groups. No studies assessed the impact of a plant-based diet on microbial composition and glucose parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicated that dietary intervention with a prebiotic or Mediterranean diet shows to beneficially improve the gut microbiota composition of <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria</i> in patients with PD or T2D. However, their beneficial effects on FBG and HbA1c were less clear and uncertain due to limited reports, particularly regarding the Mediterranean dietary intervention."

            "abstract": "Nutritional epidemiology has recently been criticized on several fronts, including the inability to measure diet accurately, and for its reliance on observational studies to address etiologic questions. In addition, several recent meta-analyses with serious methodologic flaws have arrived at erroneous or misleading conclusions, reigniting controversy over formerly settled debates. All of this has raised questions regarding the ability of nutritional epidemiologic studies to inform policy. These criticisms, to a large degree, stem from a misunderstanding of the methodologic issues of the field and the inappropriate use of the drug trial paradigm in nutrition research. The exposure of interest in nutritional epidemiology is human diet, which is a complex system of interacting components that cumulatively affect health. Consequently, nutritional epidemiology constantly faces a unique set of challenges and continually develops specific methodologies to address these. Misunderstanding these issues can lead to the nonconstructive and sometimes naive criticisms we see today. This article aims to clarify common misunderstandings of nutritional epidemiology, address challenges to the field, and discuss the utility of nutritional science in guiding policy by focusing on 5 broad questions commonly asked of the field."

These conditions arise from multiple risk factors, including inflammation, insulin resistance, impaired blood lipid profile, endothelial dysfunction, and increased cardiovascular risk. Adopting a plant-based diet has gained popularity as a viable alternative to promote health and mitigate the incidence of, and risk factors associated with, these three health conditions. Understanding the potential benefits of a plant-based diet for human health is crucial, particularly in the face of the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Thus, this review focused on the plausible advantages of consuming a type of food pattern for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases, emphasizing the dietary aspects that contribute to these conditions and the evidence supporting the benefits of a plant-based diet for human health. To facilitate a more in-depth analysis, we present separate evidence for each of these three concepts, acknowledging their intrinsic connection while providing a specific focus on each one. This review underscores the potential of a plant-based diet to target the underlying causes of these chronic diseases and enhance health outcomes for individuals and populations."

We aimed to compare the effects of Mediterranean diet (MD) and Chinese diets high or low in plants on body weight and glucose homeostasis among high-risk Chinese. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this parallel-arm randomized controlled trial, 253 Chinese adults aged 25 to 60 years with a body mass index ≥ 24.0 kg/m2 and fasting blood glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol/L were randomly assigned to 3 isocaloric-restricted diets: MD (n = 84), a traditional Jiangnan diet high in plants (TJD, n = 85), or a control diet low in plants (CD, n = 84). During the 6-month trial, a 5-weekday full-feeding regimen was followed, along with mobile app-based monitoring. Abdominal fat measurement (magnetic resonance imaging), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were conducted at baseline and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: With a 25% calorie restriction for 6 months, weight deduction was 5.72 kg (95% confidence interval, 5.03-6.40) for MD, 5.05 kg (4.38-5.73) for TJD, and 5.38 kg (4.70-6.06) for CD (Ptime < 0.0001). No between-group differences were found for fasting glucose, insulin, and the Matsuda index from OGTT. Notably, CD had significantly longer time below range (glucose < 3.9 mmol/L) than MD (0.81% [0.21-1.40], P = 0.024) and marginally longer time than TJD (0.56% [-0.03 to 1.15], P = 0.065), as measured by CGM. CONCLUSIONS: With the 6-month isocaloric-restricted feeding, TJD and MD achieved comparable weight deduction and improved glucose homeostasis, whereas CD showed a higher risk for hypoglycemia."

We aimed to examine longitudinal associations of plant-based diets and genetic susceptibility with NAFLD risk. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included 159,222 participants (58.0 ± 8.0 years old, 55.7% female) free of NAFLD in the UK Biobank. We calculated the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and the unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). New-onset NAFLD was the primary outcome. The weighted polygenic risk score was calculated based on risk variants associated with NAFLD. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model. Magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) measured liver fat content in a subsample of 20,692 participants (57.5 ± 7.4 years old, 52.6% female) was the secondary outcome. The associations between plant-based diet indices and MRI-PDFF were evaluated using generalized linear models. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.5 years, 1541 new-onset NAFLD cases were documented. Compared to the lowest quintile, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of NAFLD in the highest quintile were 0.78 (95% confidential intervals [CI], 0.66-0.93, p-trend =0.02), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.62-0.87, p-trend <0.0001), and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.05-1.46, p-trend = 0.02) for overall PDI, hPDI, and uPDI, respectively. For liver fat content, higher overall PDI and hPDI were associated with lower MRI-PDFF, while higher uPDI was associated with higher liver fat content. We observed a significant interaction between hPDI and PRS (p-interaction =0.03), and the NAFLD risk was lowest among participants with the highest hPDI and low genetic risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of plant-based diets especially healthful plant-based diets was associated with lower NAFLD risk and liver fat content regardless of genetic susceptibility, whereas an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with higher NAFLD risk and intrahepatic steatosis. These results suggest that the quality of plant-based foods should be highlighted when adopting a plant-based diet."

In this context, appropriate nutrition patterns are pivotal as they represent the basic approach for providing a wide range of substantial advantages. The best evidence for dyslipidemia management is offered by the Mediterranean Diet, the Plant-Based Diet, the High-Fiber Diet and the Anti-inflammatory Diet, while the DASH Diet and the Ketogenic Diet have also been shown to target additional pathological features like hypertension and other comorbidities. The bioactive compounds that are enriched in these nutrition patterns and able to manage dyslipidemia include monounsaturated fatty acids such as ω-3, polyphenols such as oleuropein, resveratrol, flavonoids, and catechins, carotenoids, phytosterols and soluble and unsoluble fibers. Diets rich in these compounds can improve lipid profile by mitigating oxidative stress, reducing low-grade chronic inflammation, modulating macronutrient absorption and other mechanisms, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, lifestyle interventions such as regular physical activity, weight loss, reduced alcohol consumption and smoking cessation further ameliorate lipid metabolism and manage circulated lipid profile. Furthermore, emerging insights from nutrigenomics underscore the potential for proper diet to address genetic factors and optimize treatment outcomes. The pivotal role of nutrition interventions in the context of dyslipidemia and its cardiometabolic implications is discussed in this review, emphasizing evidence-based and personalized approaches."

Four studies met the inclusion criteria, including two intervention studies reporting improvement in the pain visual analogue scale (p < 0.05) and a decrease in the health assessment questionnaire for rheumatoid arthritis score (p < 0.05) in the Mediterranean diet groups. Only one study reported a reduction in the 28 joint count disease activity score for rheumatoid arthritis for the Mediterranean diet group (p < 0.05). This review has identified beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet in reducing pain and increasing physical function in people living with rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support widespread recommendation of the Mediterranean diet for prevention of rheumatoid arthritis."

            "abstract": "Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia pose a significant global health, social, and economic challenge. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically been viewed as the leading cause of dementia, recent evidence reveals the considerable impact of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), which now accounts for nearly half of all dementia cases. The Mediterranean diet-characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil-has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits and may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. To investigate the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive health, we conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. The studies included in the meta-nalysis examined the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the incidence of dementia and AD. We applied a random-effects model to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed heterogeneity through I-square statistics. Forest plots, funnel plots, and Z-score plots were used to visualize study outcomes. Of the 324 full-text records reviewed, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR for cognitive impairment among those adhering to the Mediterranean diet was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89); for dementia, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95); and for AD, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.82), indicating substantial protective effects. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, though Z-score plots suggested sufficient sample sizes to support reliable conclusions for each condition. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with an 11-30% reduction in the risk of age-related cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD. These findings underscore the Mediterranean diet's potential as a central element in neuroprotective public health strategies to mitigate the global impact of cognitive decline and dementia and to promote healthier cognitive aging."

Repeated measurements of dietary intake are able to improve subject classification and to increase the quality of the assessed relationships in nutritional epidemiology. Beyond observational studies, randomized trials provide stronger causal evidence. In the context of a randomized trial of primary cardiovascular prevention, we assessed type 2 diabetes incidence according to yearly repeated measures of compliance with a nutritional intervention based on the traditional Mediterranean diet. METHODS: PREDIMED (''PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea'') was a Spanish trial including 7447 men and women at high cardiovascular risk. We assessed 3541 participants initially free of diabetes and originally randomized to 1 of 3 diets: low-fat diet (n = 1147, control group), Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive (n = 1154) or Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts (n = 1240). As exposure we used actual adherence to Mediterranean diet (cumulative average), yearly assessed with the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (scoring 0 to 14 points), and repeated up to 8 times (baseline and 7 consecutive follow-up years). This score was categorized into four groups: < 8, 8-< 10, 10- < 12, and 12-14 points. The outcome was new-onset type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios from time-varying Cox models were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.92) per + 2 points in Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (linear trend p = .001), and 0.46 (0.25-0.83) for the highest (12-14 points) versus the lowest (< 8) adherence. This inverse association was maintained after additionally adjusting for the randomized arm. Age- and sex-adjusted analysis of a validated plasma metabolomic signature of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (constituted of 67 metabolites) in a subset of 889 participants also supported these results. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention trials should quantify actual dietary adherence throughout the trial period to enhance the benefits and to assist results interpretation. A rapid dietary assessment tool, yearly repeated as a screener, was able to capture a strong inverse linear relationship between Mediterranean diet and type 2 diabetes.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recommendations for the reporting of nutritional epidemiology and dietary assessment research were developed following a systematic and consultative process, coordinated by a multidisciplinary group of 21 experts. Consensus on reporting guidelines was reached through a three-round Delphi consultation process with 53 external experts. In total, 24 recommendations for nutritional epidemiology were added to the STROBE checklist. CONCLUSION: When used appropriately, reporting guidelines for nutritional epidemiology can contribute to improve reporting of observational studies with a focus on diet and health."

Methods and Results We used data from a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults (n=12 168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants' diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant-based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant-based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant-based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant-based diet index and the outcomes.

Despite the wide variety of popular diets, some general principles can be gleaned from investigating their potential impact on nephrolithiasis. Plant-based diets, including Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Mediterranean, flexitarian, and vegetarian diets, may protect against nephrolithiasis when they consist largely of unprocessed plant foods, while carbohydrate-restricted diets (including high-protein diets and the ketogenic diet) may raise kidney stone risk. Patients should be advised to consume a diet rich in whole plants, particularly fruits and vegetables, and minimize their consumption of animal proteins. Accompanying fruits and vegetables that are higher in oxalate content with more water and some dairy intake may also be useful. (We address the oxalate content of fruits and vegetables further below). Calcium consumption is an important component of decreasing the risk of kidney stones, as higher dietary calcium from dairy or nondairy sources is independently associated with lower kidney stone risk. Patients should also be advised to be conscious of fat intake, as fat in the intestinal lumen may complex with calcium and therefore increase urinary oxalate excretion. Finally, patients should avoid consumption of processed foods, which often contain added fructose and high sodium content, two factors that increase kidney stone risk."

This study investigated the prospective associations of plant-based diets with the risk of CKD progression and all-cause mortality in individuals with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 2,539 participants with CKD recruited between 2003-2008 into the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. EXPOSURE: Responses on the Diet History Questionnaire were used to calculate scores for the overall plant-based diet index, healthy plant-based diet index, and unhealthy plant-based diet index. OUTCOME: (1) CKD progression defined as≥50% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline from baseline or kidney replacement therapy (dialysis, transplant) and (2) all-cause mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox proportional hazards models to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusting for lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical covariates. RESULTS: There were 977 CKD progression events and 836 deaths during a median follow-up period of 7 and 12 years, respectively. Participants with the highest versus lowest adherence to overall plant-based diets and healthy plant-based diets had 26% (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.62-0.88], P trend<0.001) and 21% (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.95], P trend=0.03) lower risks of all-cause mortality, respectively. Each 10-point higher score of unhealthy plant-based diets was modestly associated with a higher risk of CKD progression (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.03-1.25) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00-1.23). LIMITATIONS: Self-reported diet may be subject to measurement error. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to an overall plant-based diet and a healthy plant-based diet is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with CKD. An unhealthy plant-based was associated with an elevated risk of CKD progression and all-cause mortality. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Plant-based diets are healthful dietary patterns that have been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases. However, the impact of plant-based diets on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well established. In 2,539 individuals with CKD, we examined the associations of adherence to 3 different types of plant-based diets with the risks of CKD progression and all-cause mortality. We found that following an overall plant-based diet and a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. By contrast, following an unhealthy plant-based diet was associated with a higher risk of CKD progression and all-cause mortality. These results suggest that the quality of plant-based diets may be important for CKD management."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: several previous studies have shown the importance of the plant-based diets. However, not all plant-based foods are necessarily beneficial for dementia or depression. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between an overall plant-based diet and the incidence of dementia or depression. METHODS: we included 180,532 participants from the UK Biobank cohort study, free of a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia and depression at baseline. We calculated an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) based on 17 major food groups from Oxford WebQ. Dementia and depression were evaluated using hospital inpatient records in UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between PDIs and the incidence of dementia or depression. RESULTS: during the follow-up, 1,428 dementia cases and 6,781 depression cases were documented. After adjusting for several potential confounders and comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of three plant-based diet indices, the multivariable hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for dementia were 1.03 (0.87, 1.23) for PDI, 0.82 (0.68, 0.98) for hPDI and 1.29 (1.08, 1.53) for uPDI. The hazard ratios (95% CI) for depression were 1.06 (0.98, 1.14) for PDI, 0.92 (0.85, 0.99) for hPDI and 1.15 (1.07, 1.24) for uPDI. CONCLUSION: a plant-based diet rich in healthier plant foods was associated with a lower risk of dementia and depression, whereas a plant-based diet that emphasises less-healthy plant foods was associated with a higher risk of dementia and depression."

            "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet has gained significant attention for its potential health benefits on diverse pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and inflammation. Numerous observational studies have suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, may have protective effects against OA. The abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds and omega-3 fatty acids, among the Mediterranean diet components is believed to contribute to its beneficial effects on OA. Research investigating the association between the Mediterranean diet and OA has shown promising results. Several observational studies have reported that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing OA and with lower severity of OA symptoms. Additionally, intervention studies have demonstrated improvements in pain, function, and quality of life among OA patients following a Mediterranean diet intervention. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against OA, including its ability to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degradation. However, further well-designed randomized controlled trials and mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and establish causality. In conclusion, the Mediterranean diet appears to be a promising dietary approach for the prevention and management of OA. Its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds may exert protective effects against OA development and progression, although more research is warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate underlying mechanisms."

Additionally, incorporating more plant-based foods into a Mediterranean diet may provide further health benefits. The study aimed to assess the effect of shifting from a traditional Mediterranean diet to a vegan Mediterranean diet on cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profile in physically active and healthy men. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants underwent a baseline period with adhesion to the general patterns of the Mediterranean diet for three weeks and then they changed to an isocaloric vegan version of the Mediterranean diet for four weeks, with a 7-day washout period between diets. The shift from the traditional Mediterranean diet to the vegan Mediterranean diet required substituting animal-based foods with plant-based foods that contain comparable amounts of protein and fat. Fourteen participants with a mean age of 24.6 ± 7.0 years (range: 18-37 years), completed the study protocol. The change from the traditional to the vegan Mediterranean diet reduced blood concentration of total cholesterol (-22.6 mg/dl, p < 0.01, Effect size [ES] = 1.07) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.8 mg/dl, p < 0.01, ES = 0.72). An inverse correlation was observed between the intake of dietary fibre and LDL-C (partial rho = -0.43, p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a vegan Mediterranean diet with plant-based proteins and fats instead of the traditional Mediterranean diet improved several cardiometabolic health outcomes in physically active and healthy men.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) result from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental and aging factors. A balanced diet and adequate physical activity (PA) are recognized as pivotal components among modifiable environmental factors. The independent impact on NDD incidence has been previously debated. This investigation seeks to delineate the association between PA and NDDs across various levels of adherence to a plant-based diet. METHODS: In this study, a cohort of 368,934 participants from the UK Biobank was analyzed. Total physical activity (TPA) levels and healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) were calculated and categorized. A multiple adjusted Cox model was utilized to evaluate the influence of TPA and hPDI on common NDDs, respectively. RESULTS: Finally, 4602 identified cases diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that higher TPA was significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing AD (Q3: HR 0.87; Q4: HR 0.78) and PD (Q3: HR 0.86; Q4: HR 0.81). The protective effect was further accentuated with adherence to a plant-based diet. However, these connections were not observed in the analysis of ALS regardless of dietary patterns. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore a significant association between higher TPA and reduced risks of AD and PD, with an enhanced effect observed in conjunction with a plant-based diet. This study contributes to addressing the knowledge gap regarding the combined impact of TPA and a plant-based diet on NDDs occurrence, providing insights into potential underlying mechanisms."

This paper surveys literature pertinent to the Mediterranean diet with respect to schizophrenia, bipolar and unipolar depression and cognition. The National Library of Medicine database of literature was searched for publications relating to our topic through June 2024. Our results highlight the Mediterranean diet's potential role in mediating inflammation, potentially through the gut-brain axis, and its neuroprotective role against cognitive decline. Moreover, individual components of the Mediterranean diet are potentially therapeutic as well as protective, particularly fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, and whole grains. These dietary components reduce systemic inflammation, modulate gut microbiota and influence critical pathways such as moderating oxidative stress. Overall, this survey of recent literature highlights the potential of the Mediterranean diet to promote mental health and reduce the risk or severity of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The analysis underscores broader implications for the Mediterranean diet in advancing mental health outcomes and emphasizes the need for further studies and increased public education to encourage healthier eating habits and dietary interventions."

This is the first study to evaluate the association between various diet quality indices and CKD incidence in British adults. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between a set of 6 different diet quality indices and CKD incidence among British adults. METHODS: A prospective cohort with 106,870 participants from the UK Biobank, followed from 2009 to 2012 through 2021. Food consumption was obtained from ≥2 24-h dietary assessments. Dietary patterns were assessed using previously established indices: Alternate Mediterranean Index (aMED), Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), and dietary inflammatory index (DII). Incident CKD was obtained from clinical records, death registries, and self-reports. Analyses were performed with Cox regression models and adjusted for the main confounders. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.27 y, 2934 cases of CKD were ascertained. Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of CKD for the highest compared with lowest tertile of adherence to each diet score were 0.84 (0.76, 0.93) for aMED, 0.94 (0.85, 1.03) for alternative healthy eating index 2010, 0.77 (0.70, 0.85) for DASH, 0.79 (0.72, 0.87) for hPDI, 1.27 (1.16, 1.40) for uPDI, and 1.20 (1.18, 1.33) for DII. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In British adults, higher adherence to the aMED, DASH, and hPDI patterns was associated with lower risk of CKD, whereas greater adherence to the uPDI and DII patterns was associated with greater risk."

Whilst plant-based diets have been followed in many regions of the world, the planetary concern and the published health benefits has increased the uptake of such diets. This review sets out to explore the impact on growth in children following a plant-based diet. RECENT FINDINGS: Twelve observational studies were published between 2017 and 2024, assessing the impact of vegan and vegetarian diets compared to omnivorous diets in children. Ten studies found no significant difference in growth parameters between children on the plant-based diet vs. the omnivorous diet, however there is a trend of lower growth parameters including undernutrition, but also lower rates of overweight in children on a plant-based diet. One study found that that children were shorter on a vegan diet and another found that infants born to mothers following a vegan diet had significantly lower weight. None of the studies assessed children that received professional dietary advice. SUMMARY: Overall, growth is comparable in children following a plant-based diet, but a higher risk for undernutrition has been highlighted. Children can follow a plant-based diet and establish good growth with the help of a qualified healthcare professional understanding macro and micronutrient provision on such a diet."

            "abstract": "Plant-based diets, both vegan and vegetarian, which emphasize grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds are increasingly popular for health as well as financial, ethical, and religious reasons. The medical literature clearly demonstrates that whole food plant-based diets can be both nutritionally sufficient and medically beneficial. However, any person on an intentionally restrictive, but poorly-designed diet may predispose themselves to clinically-relevant nutritional deficiencies. For persons on a poorly-designed plant-based diet, deficiencies are possible in both macronutrients (protein, essential fatty acids) and micronutrients (vitamin B12, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin D). Practitioner evaluation of symptomatic patients on a plant-based diet requires special consideration of seven key nutrient concerns for plant-based diets. This article translates these concerns into seven practical questions that all practitioners can introduce into their patient assessments and clinical reasoning. Ideally, persons on plant-based diets should be able to answer these seven questions. Each serves as a heuristic prompt for both clinician and patient attentiveness to a complete diet. As such, these seven questions support increased patient nutrition knowledge and practitioner capacity to counsel, refer, and appropriately focus clinical resources."

We investigated associations of plant-based dietary patterns with inflammation biomarkers and body composition in the Pathways Study, in which 3659 women with breast cancer provided validated food frequency questionnaires approximately 2 months after diagnosis. We derived three plant-based diet indices: overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). We assayed circulating inflammation biomarkers related to systemic inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13). We estimated areas (cm<sup>2</sup>) of muscle and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT) from computed tomography scans. Using multivariable linear regression, we calculated the differences in inflammation biomarkers and body composition for each index. Per 10-point increase for each index: hsCRP was significantly lower by 6·9 % (95 % CI 1·6%, 11·8%) for PDI and 9·0 % (95 % CI 4·9%, 12·8%) for hPDI but significantly higher by 5·4 % (95 % CI 0·5%, 10·5%) for uPDI, and VAT was significantly lower by 7·8 cm<sup>2</sup> (95 % CI 2·0 cm<sup>2</sup>, 13·6 cm<sup>2</sup>) for PDI and 8·6 cm<sup>2</sup> (95 % CI 4·1 cm<sup>2</sup>, 13·2 cm<sup>2</sup>) for hPDI but significantly higher by 6·2 cm<sup>2</sup> (95 % CI 1·3 cm<sup>2</sup>, 11·1 cm<sup>2</sup>) for uPDI. No significant associations were observed for other inflammation biomarkers, muscle, or SAT. A plant-based diet, especially a healthful plant-based diet, may be associated with reduced inflammation and visceral adiposity among breast cancer survivors."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amino acids are critical to tumor survival. Tumors can acquire amino acids from the surrounding microenvironment, including the serum. Limiting dietary amino acids is suggested to influence their serum levels. Further, a plant-based diet is reported to contain fewer amino acids than an animal-based diet. The extent to which a plant-based diet lowers the serum levels of amino acids in patients with cancer is unclear. METHODS: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (n = 17) were enrolled in a clinical trial with an ad libitum whole food, plant-based diet for 8 weeks without calorie or portion restriction. Dietary changes by participants were monitored using a three-day food record. Serum was collected from participants at baseline and 8 weeks. Food records and serum were analyzed for metabolic changes. RESULTS: We found that a whole food, plant-based diet resulted in a lower intake of calories, fat, and amino acids and higher levels of fiber. Additionally, body weight, serum insulin, and IGF were reduced in participants. The diet contained lower levels of essential and non-essential amino acids, except for arginine (glutamine and asparagine were not measured). Importantly, the lowered dietary intake of amino acids translated to reduced serum levels of amino acids in participants (5/9 essential amino acids; 4/11 non-essential amino acids). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a tractable approach to limiting amino acid levels in persons with cancer. This data lays a foundation for studying the relationship between amino acids in patients and tumor progression. Further, a whole-food, plant-based diet has the potential to synergize with cancer therapies that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03045289 on 2017-02-07."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) pyramid was officially published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1995. Since then, our understanding of the role of the MedDiet and its role in reducing risk of chronic diseases has grown substantially. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to provide a narrative review of the historical context of the MedDiet and its environmental impact, summarize health-related evidence from the past 3 decades, and explore its practical applications and cultural adaptations. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through searches of PubMed and other major databases. We prioritzed publications from the past 3 decades, while also including influential earlier studies where appropriate. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively to summarize key findings and identify gaps for future research. RESULTS: A large body of evidence from prospective cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, and mechanistic studies consistently supports the benefits of the MedDiet for the prevention of chronic diseases, particularly cardiometabolic diseases and the improvement of healthy aging. Growing evidence demonstrates that the MedDiet promotes favorable changes in circulating metabolites and gut microbiome composition, providing novel insights into biological mechanisms underlying its health benefits and informing the development of precision nutrition strategies. The MedDiet aligns with the principles of the planetary health diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission, which aims to promote both human health and environmental sustainability. The development of the MedDiet pyramid 30 y ago inspired the creation of the Asian, African, and Latin-American heritage diet pyramids. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 3 decades, substantial evidence has accumulated to strongly support the benefits of the MedDiet in preventing chronic diseases and promoting healthy aging. Despite robust evidence, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and adaptability of the MedDiet across diverse populations, cultural settings, and food environments."

We used three plant-based diet indices including an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. <i>Results</i>: During a median of 17.1 years of follow-up, we documented 19 456 deaths, including 5489 deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 6172 deaths from cancer. Comparing the highest <i>versus</i> lowest quintiles of the PDI, the multivariable-adjusted HR of all-cause mortality was 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.87, <i>P</i> for trend < 0.001).

GDM has been associated with various obstetric complications, such as polyhydramnios, preterm delivery, and increased cesarean delivery rate. Moreover, the fetus could suffer from congenital malformation, macrosomia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and intrauterine death. It has been speculated that inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) 6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) impact on endothelium dysfunction and insulin resistance and contribute to the pathogenesis of GDM. Nutritional patterns enriched with plant-derived foods, such as a low glycemic or Mediterranean diet, might favorably impact on the incidence of GDM. A high intake of vegetables, fibers, and fruits seems to decrease inflammation by enhancing antioxidant compounds. This aspect contributes to improving insulin efficacy and metabolic control and could provide maternal and neonatal health benefits. Our review aims to deepen the understanding of the impact of a plant-based diet on oxidative stress in GDM."

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is considered a strong predictor of CVD. The underlying defect in arteriogenic ED is endothelial dysfunction. A plant-based diet focused on whole plant foods could enhance penile erection as it improves endothelial function through various mechanisms. First, it provides nitrates, L-arginine, and L-citrulline, substrates for nitric oxide production. In addition, this diet lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, trimethylamine N-oxide, postprandial triglycerides, advanced glycation end product, inflammation, and vasoconstrictors levels, contributing to higher nitric oxide concentrations, increased endothelial progenitor cells preservation and decreased arterial stiffness. This review explores the epidemiological evidence of a plant-based diet emphasizing whole plant foods on ED and the potential biological pathways involved."

            "abstract": "A plant-based diet is increasingly becoming recognized as a healthier alternative to a diet laden with meat. Atherosclerosis associated with high dietary intake of meat, fat, and carbohydrates remains the leading cause of mortality in the US. This condition results from progressive damage to the endothelial cells lining the vascular system, including the heart, leading to endothelial dysfunction. In addition to genetic factors associated with endothelial dysfunction, many dietary and other lifestyle factors, such as tobacco use, high meat and fat intake, and oxidative stress, are implicated in atherogenesis. Polyphenols derived from dietary plant intake have protective effects on vascular endothelial cells, possibly as antioxidants that prevent the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. Recently, metabolites of L-carnitine, such as trimethylamine-N-oxide, that result from ingestion of red meat have been identified as a potential predictive marker of coronary artery disease (CAD). Metabolism of L-carnitine by the intestinal microbiome is associated with atherosclerosis in omnivores but not in vegetarians, supporting CAD benefits of a plant-based diet. Trimethylamine-N-oxide may cause atherosclerosis via macrophage activation. We suggest that a shift toward a plant-based diet may confer protective effects against atherosclerotic CAD by increasing endothelial protective factors in the circulation while reducing factors that are injurious to endothelial cells. The relative ratio of protective factors to injurious endothelial exposure may be a novel approach to assessing an objective dietary benefit from a plant-based diet. This review provides a mechanistic perspective of the evidence for protection by a plant-based diet against atherosclerotic CAD."

SETTING: Community-based setting in 22 provinces of China. PARTICIPANTS: The final sample included data from 3990 older adults from 2011-2014 from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. MEASUREMENTS: A plant-based diet index (PDI) was calculated based on a qualitative food frequency questionnaire. Frailty was defined using modified Fried criteria. A Generalized Estimating Equation was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for frailty. We further performed subgroup analyses stratified by sex and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: 557 cases of frailty were observed. After adjustment for covariates, the RR for frailty of a high PDI was 0.792 (95% CI: 0.644-0.973), relative to a low PDI. During follow-up, compared with respondents with a continually low PDI, the respondents with a continually high PDI had a significantly reduced risk of frailty (RR = 0.683, 95% CI: 0.514-0.908). In further subgroup analysis, a consistently high PDI over time resulted in a significantly reduced risk of frailty for male (RR = 0.591, 95% CI: 0.391-0.893); for never smokers (RR = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.458-0.979); for people who did never consume alcohol (RR = 0.654, 95% CI: 0.454-0.941); and for people with current or former exercise habits (RR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.313-0.762). CONCLUSION: Plant-based diet was associated with low risk of frailty in men and in older adults with healthy lifestyle. These findings stress that plant-based diet should be recommended as a dietary strategy to prevent and reduce frailty in older adults; in addition, more dietary interventions along with lifestyle modification should be adopted to promote successful ageing, especially for women."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant-based dietary patterns may affect colorectal cancer (CRC) related outcomes, while risks differ in the quality of plant foods. We aimed to examine the association of plant-based diet quality with risks of CRC incidence and mortality and whether this association was modified by genetic risk. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 186,675 participants free of cancer when the last dietary recall was completed. We calculated three plant-based diet indices (PDIs), i.e., the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and the unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) representing adherence to plant-based diets with diverse quality. Genetic risk was characterized using a weighted polygenic risk score (PRS), capturing overall risk variants associated with CRC. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) were estimated by the cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Over a follow-up of 9.5 years, 2163 cases and 466 deaths from CRC were documented. The HR of CRC incidence was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99) per 10-score increase in PDI and hPDI, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile, PDI, hPDI, and uPDI in the highest quartile were associated with a 13% decrease, a 15% decrease, and a 14% increase in risk of incident CRC, respectively. We found a joint association of genetic risk and PDIs with incident CRC, with the highest hazard observed in those carrying higher PRS and adhering to lower-quality PDIs. The inverse association of PDI and hPDI with CRC mortality was pronounced in males. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that better adherence to overall and healthful plant-based diets was associated with a lower risk of CRC, whereas an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with a higher CRC risk. Consumption of a higher-quality plant-based diet combined with decreased genetic risk conferred less susceptibility to CRC. Our findings highlighted the importance of food quality when adhering to a plant-based dietary pattern for CRC prevention in the general population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plant-based diet is growing in popularity throughout the world for various reasons, yet its effect on bone health, especially osteoporosis, remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the association between plant-based diet and risk of osteoporosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search of observational studies examining the relationship between plant-based diets and osteoporosis risk was performed across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest from inception to June 1, 2024. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. To synthesize effect estimates, a random-effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting was applied to pool odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: This study encompassed 20 original observational studies collectively involving 243,366 participants. Primary analysis revealed that plant-based diet was associated with the risk of osteoporosis at the lumbar spine (OR = 2.44, 95%CI = 1.12-5.33, P = 0.02; τ<sup>2</sup> = 1.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 91.7 %), compared to omnivorous diet. The association remained directionally consistent although attenuated to non-significant at the femoral neck (OR = 1.91, 95%CI = 0.68-5.42, P = 0.22; τ<sup>2</sup> = 3.28; I<sup>2</sup> = 94.9 %). Subgroup analysis revealed vegans (FN: OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 0.94-3.54, P = 0.10; LS: OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.00-2.12, P = 0.05) and those who followed a plant-based diet for ≥10 y (FN: OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.29-2.49, P < 0.01; LS: OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 0.97-1.87, P = 0.07) to exhibit a more pronounced risk of osteoporosis. Heterogeneity was primarily driven by study design. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that adherence to plant-based diet may be associated with an elevated risk of osteoporosis, particularly at the lumbar spine, among individuals following a vegan diet or following a plant-based diet for ≥10 y. However, the heterogeneity observed across studies highlights the need for well-designed prospective studies in future, to clarify this relationship."

Yet growing evidence indicates that once diseases like cancer or cardiovascular disease are diagnosed, the same exposures may be associated with improved survival outcomes. This phenomenon, which may be considered a risk-survival paradox in nutritional epidemiology, challenges conventional dietary frameworks that assume continuity between disease prevention and disease prognosis. In this perspective article, I examine this paradox through a detailed analysis of 4 key exposures: obesity, alcohol, cholesterol, and antioxidant supplementation, restricted to cancer and cardiovascular disease. These 2 disease areas have the most extensive and methodologically diverse literature documenting risk-survival reversals and are responsible for the highest proportion of global mortality. Key limitations including reverse causation and survivor bias are summarized, and I conclude with a cautious statement that changes to current guidelines require further studies assessing causality."

Our aim is to present plant-based diet as a primary measure for prevention. We intend to critically analyse some past stereotypes related to plant-based diet - whose main components include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds - according to the literature (e.g. protein, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid, and iron intake) by doing so we wish to create an adequate conceptual basis for its interpretation. We discuss positive physiological effects of plant-based diet and its possible role in diseases risk reduction. Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases developing due to obesity could be prevented by a properly compiled plant-based diet. For patients with cancer minimizing the intake of foods of animal origin - as opposed to plant-based ones - has proved to have positive effects. Our review suggests this diet can be used in a number of diseases and it also provides long-term sustainable solutions for the health care challenges of the newest era. Orv.

The Mediterranean diet has emerged as a potential safeguard, with observational studies indicating it might help defend against cognitive disorders. High adherence is linked with lower cognitive impairment risk, while low adherence elevates the risk for AD. Though these studies suggest connections between the Mediterranean diet and reduced cognitive decline or AD, they do not establish causality. Potential mechanisms might involve vascular factors, glucose/lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory effects. Specific Mediterranean diet components like vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish, and monounsaturated fats might contribute to cognitive benefits. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to ascertain the diet's influence on AD and cognitive health. Currently, the Mediterranean diet cannot be definitively named as a preventive strategy for AD due to insufficient evidence. More research is essential to identify key ingredients and processes that might have preventive effects on AD. In summary, while the Mediterranean diet shows promise against cognitive decline and AD, further research is needed."

The purpose of this narrative review is to update the most recent evidence from large prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses on the effects of plant-based dietary patterns on cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors and total mortality. RECENT FINDINGS: Most new data from large prospective cohort studies carried out in the USA, Europe, and Asia continue to show inverse associations between plant-based diets and the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke, while less data exist for heart failure incidence. New analyses suggest that only some components of plant-based diets are associated with cardiovascular benefit. Recent meta-analyses show inverse associations between plant-protein intake and all-cause mortality, although heterogeneity exists, and small mortality risks from some animal proteins, notably processed meats. New studies continue to demonstrate small but favorable effects of plant-based diets on traditional risk factors and suggest other emerging mechanisms by which plant-based diets exert cardiovascular benefits. The recommendation to consume a plant-based diet to reduce cardiovascular risk remains an evidence-based strategy based on observational studies. New data highlight the importance of ensuring that these diets are nutrient-rich and low in plant foods associated with signals of harm. For this reason, assessment of diet quality is important even in patients who report adherence to plant-based diets. Large randomized trials with hard cardiovascular endpoints might strengthen this evidence-base, but feasibility is limited."

There is also a growing interest worldwide in environmental sustainability of dietary patterns, with increasing concern about their effects on planetary health. In this context, whole-food, plant-based diets -such as the Mediterranean diet (MD)- have emerged as a solution for both healthier eating and lowering environmental impact. Yet in order to be effective at these goals and achieve a high adherence to any nutritional prescription, the sociocultural reality of the community or population where we aim to practice must also be taken into account.

This study investigated whether adherence to a plant-based diet is associated with kidney function in patients with ADPKD. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were calculated using dietary intake data. Among 106 ADPKD patients, 37 (34.91%) were classified as having advanced CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The overall PDI and hPDI were lower, but the uPDI was higher in patients with advanced CKD than in those with early CKD. The hPDI was negatively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. Moreover, the hPDI was inversely associated with advanced CKD [odds ratio (OR): 0.117 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.039-0.351), <i>p</i> < 0.001], and the uPDI was positively associated with advanced CKD [OR: 8.450 (95% CI: 2.810-25.409), <i>p</i> < 0.001]. The findings of the current study demonstrate that greater adherence to a healthful plant-based diet is associated with improved kidney function in ADPKD patients."

METHODS: Using an National Cancer Institute-sponsored trial (CALGB/SWOG 80405), we included 1284 patients who completed validated food frequency questionnaires at the initiation of metastatic CRC treatment. We calculated 3 indices: overall plant-based diet index (PDI), which emphasized consumption of all plant foods while reducing animal food intake; healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), which emphasized consumption of healthful plant foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), which emphasized consumption of less healthful plant foods such as fruit juices, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages. We estimated the associations of 3 indices (quintiles) with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We observed 1100 deaths and 1204 progression events (median follow-up = 6.1 years). Compared with the lowest quintile, patients in the highest quintile of PDI had significantly better survival (hazard ratio [HR] for OS = 0.76 [0.62-0.94], Ptrend = .004; PFS = 0.81 [0.66-0.99], Ptrend = .09). Similar findings were observed for hPDI (HR for OS = 0.81 [0.65-1.01], Ptrend = .053; PFS = 0.80 [0.65-0.98], Ptrend = .04), whereas uPDI was not associated with worse survival (HR for OS = 1.16 [0.94-1.43], Ptrend = .21; PFS = 1.12 [0.92-1.36], Ptrend = .42). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a plant-based diet, especially when rich in healthful plant foods, is associated with better survival among patients with metastatic CRC. The cause of survival benefits warrants further investigation."

            "abstract": "Plant-based dietary patterns are comprised of a range of foods, and increasingly, diet quality indices are used to assess them and their associations with health outcomes. As the design of these indices varies, a review of existing indices is necessary to identify common features, strengths, and considerations. This scoping review aimed to synthesize the literature on plant-based diet quality indices by examining their <i>1</i>) basis for development, <i>2</i>) scoring methodology, and <i>3</i>) validation approaches. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Global Health databases were systematically searched from 1980 to 2022. Observational studies were included if they assessed plant-based diets in adults, using an <i>a priori</i> methodology with food-based components. Studies conducted among pregnant/lactating people were excluded. Thirty-five unique plant-based diet quality indices were identified in 137 included articles published between 2007 and 2022. Indices were developed to reflect epidemiological evidence for associations between foods and health outcomes (<i>n</i> = 16 indices), previous diet quality indices (<i>n</i> = 16), country-specific dietary guidelines (<i>n</i> = 9), or foods from traditional dietary patterns (<i>n</i> = 6). Indices included 4 to 33 food groups, with fruits (<i>n</i> = 32), vegetables (<i>n</i> = 32), and grains (<i>n</i> = 30) the most common. Index scoring comprised of population-specific percentile cutoffs (<i>n</i> = 18) and normative cutoffs (<i>n</i> = 13). Twenty indices differentiated between healthy and less healthy plant-based foods when scoring intakes. Validation methods included construct validity (<i>n</i> = 26), reliability (<i>n</i> = 20), and criterion validity (<i>n</i> = 5). This review highlights that most plant-based diet quality indices were derived from epidemiological research, the majority of indices differentially scored healthy and unhealthy plant and animal foods, and indices were most often evaluated for construct validity and reliability. To ensure best practice use and reporting of plant-based dietary patterns, researchers should consider the basis for development, methodology, and validation when identifying appropriate plant-based diet quality indices for use in research contexts."

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to promote health and reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases. The actual implementation of the Mediterranean diet is affected by several sociocultural factors as well as geographical components. Indeed, the geographical location, such as a specific country or different areas in a country and specific latitude and climate, appears to be an important factor that may strongly affect the implementation of the Mediterranean diet or some of its principles as well as the adherence to it. Another dynamic component affecting personal nutritional choices, also regarding adherence to the Mediterranean diet and its principles, is the individual life-long trajectory of food preference and nutrition habits and awareness. In this review, we discuss the current evidence on the impact of geographical location on adherence to the Mediterranean diet."

However, studies investigating the association between the healthiness of a plant-based diet and T2D risk are limited. This study explored the prospective association between scores from three different plant-based diet indices and risk of T2D and investigated whether associations differ by demographic and lifestyle factors in the Korean population. Data were derived from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a prospective cohort study initiated between 2001 and 2002. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Scores for three plant-based diet indices (overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI)) were measured. A total of 7363 Korean adults aged 40-69 years without T2D and related chronic diseases at baseline were included. Incident T2D was defined as elevated plasma glucose (≥126 mg/dL), self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of T2D, or use of oral hypoglycemic drug. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for T2D risk. During a follow-up period of 14 years, 977 participants developed T2D. A 10-point higher score in hPDI was associated with a 14% lower risk of T2D (HR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77-0.95), adjusting for potential confounders. In subgroup analysis, inverse associations between hPDI and T2D risk were stronger in participants with a family history of T2D (HR: 0.58, 95% CI, 0.44 0.76) or history of hypertension (HR: 0.73, 95% CI, 0.60 0.89) than those without a family history of T2D (<i>p</i> interaction = 0.01) or history of hypertension (<i>p</i> interaction = 0.04). Considering the quality of the plant foods may be important for the prevention of T2D in the Korean population, which habitually consumes diets rich in plant foods."

We aimed to examine the association of seven established dietary patterns with subsequent cholelithiasis risk and whether this association was modified by genetic risk. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study from the UK Biobank, including 155,323 participants initially free of cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy. Dietary patterns were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (Oxford WebQ), covering Mediterranean Diet Score (MED), alternate Mediterranean Diet Score(aMED), overall Plant-based Diet Index (PDI), healthy Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI), unhealthy Plant-based Diet Index (uPDI), Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) and EAT-lancet Score. Genetic risk was quantified and stratified by a polygenic risk score (PRS) incorporating 13 known cholelithiasis-associated loci. Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to estimate the association between dietary patterns, PRS, and cholelithiasis incidence, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 5,056 cases of cholelithiasis were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, adherence to aMED and HEI-2015 dietary patterns reduced cholelithiasis risk by 10% (HR: 0.90; 95%CI: 0.83-0.98) and 11% (HR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82-0.96), respectively. A significant decrease in cholelithiasis risk was observed across PRS quintiles, low PRS was associated with a 16% reduced risk (HR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.77-0.92). Participants with both high dietary scores and low genetic risk had the lowest cholelithiasis risk, with an HR of 0.76 (95%CI: 0.64-0.91) for aMED and 0.73 (95%CI: 0.61-0.88) for HEI-2015. CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to aMED and HEI-2015 might significantly decrease the risk of cholelithiasis, irrespective of genetic risk. Our results highlighted the potential of diet intervention for cholelithiasis prevention in the general population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although it is known that plant-based foods are important for physical health, little is known about the relationship between plant-based foods and cognitive health. Emerging evidence suggests that some macronutrients may influence cognition, but it is unclear which domains of cognition are involved; more importantly, it is unknown how a plant-based diet relates to cognition. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between a plant-based dietary pattern and cognitive functioning. METHODS: Participants were 3,039 older adults who participated in the 2011-2014 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The present cross-sectional study used data on macronutrient intake from 24-hour dietary interviews, as well as performance on tests of long-term memory and executive function (i.e., delayed word recall, digit symbol substitution test, and animal fluency). Principal component analysis was used to extract a dietary pattern consistent with a plant-based diet. RESULTS: Greater adherence to a dietary pattern consistent with a plant-based diet was related to better performance on all cognitive tasks. Secondary analyses indicated that the associations between a plant-based dietary pattern and executive function accounted for the association between a plant-based dietary pattern and memory. Furthermore, this same plant-based dietary pattern was associated with reduced baseline inflammation in a separate dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental manipulations are needed to determine the potential causal relations of these associations, but these results suggest that a plant-based diet relates to better cognition, especially through improved executive control. Future work should also attempt to extend these results by examining potential mechanisms underlying these associations, such as reduced inflammation."

The study of complete dietary patterns represents the most adequate approach to assess the role of diet on the risk of diabetes. The term 'Mediterranean diet' essentially refers to a primarily plant-based dietary pattern whose greater consumption has been associated with higher survival for lower all-cause mortality. At least five large prospective studies report a substantially lower risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy people or at risk patients with the highest adherence to a Mediterranean diet. Five randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effects of a Mediterranean diet, as compared with other commonly used diets, on glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Improvement of HbA1c levels was greater with a Mediterranean diet and ranged from 0.1% to 0.6% for HbA1c . No trial reported worsening of glycaemic control with a Mediterranean diet. Although no controlled trial specifically assessed the role of a Mediterranean diet in reducing cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that post-infarct or high-risk patients, including diabetic patients, may have cardiovascular benefits from a Mediterranean diet. The evidence so far accumulated suggests that adopting a Mediterranean diet may help prevent type 2 diabetes; moreover, a lower carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diet seems good for HbA1c reduction in persons with established diabetes."

An overview of the historical antecedents and recent increased interest in the Mediterranean diet is presented and challenges related to how to improve the sustainability of the Mediterranean diet are identified. Despite its increasing popularity worldwide, adherence to the Mediterranean diet model is decreasing for multifactorial influences - life styles changes, food globalization, economic, and socio-cultural factors. These changes pose serious threats to the preservation and transmission of the Mediterranean diet heritage to present and future generations. Today's challenge is to reverse such trends. A greater focus on the Mediterranean diet's potential as a sustainable dietary pattern, instead than just on its well-documented healthy benefits, can contribute to its enhancement. More cross-disciplinary studies on environmental, economic and socio-cultural, and sustainability dimensions of the Mediterranean diet are foreseen as a critical need."

Therefore, we investigated the associations between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive ageing. METHODS: Data from a previous intervention study involving community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years were analysed at baseline (n = 658) and after 2-year follow-up (n = 314). Global and domain-specific cognitive functioning were assessed at both timepoints. Overall, healthful and unhealthful plant-based dietary indices were calculated from a 190-item food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted linear regression models were applied to test for associations. RESULTS: After full-adjustment, higher overall adherence to a plant-based diet was not associated with global cognitive function (difference in Z-score, tertile 1 versus 3 [95% CI]: 0.04 [- 0.05, 0.13] p = 0.40) or cognitive change (- 0.04 [- 0.11, 0.04], p = 0.35). Similarly, healthful and unhealthful plant-based diet indices were not associated with cognitive functioning (respectively p = 0.48; p = 0.87) or change (respectively p = 0.21, p = 0.33). Interestingly, we observed fish consumption to influence the association between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive functioning (p-interaction = 0.01), with only individuals with a fish consumption of ≥ 0.93 portion/week benefitting from better overall plant-based diet adherence (β per 10-point increment [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.03, 0.21] p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: We did not demonstrate associations of a more plant-based diet with cognitive ageing. However, possibly such association exists in a subpopulation with higher fish intake. This would be in line with earlier observations that diets rich in plant foods and fish, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be beneficial for cognitive ageing.

            "abstract": "Dietary patterns have been shown to worsen or alleviate several dermatological diseases. A well-balanced, plant-based diet is known to have anti-inflammatory, probiotic, and antioxidant properties, along with weight loss-promoting effects. Moreover, a plant-based diet has a low glycemic load, improving metabolic disease. Due to these qualities, plant-based diets may have beneficial effects on inflammatory skin conditions. In this review, we aim to discuss the possible mechanisms by which a plant-based diet reduces disease severity in psoriasis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and atopic dermatitis. We also aim to clarify how a plant-based diet may influence skin healing and identify sources of vitamins, nutrients, fatty acids, and protein in a well-balanced, plant-based diet. We performed a literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE databases with the following keywords: \"plant-based\" OR \"vegan\" OR \"vegetarian\" OR \"meat\" OR \"diet\" AND \"psoriasis\" OR \"hidradenitis suppurativa\" OR \"acne\" OR \"atopic dermatitis\" OR \"skin healing\" OR \"dermatology\". Our findings demonstrate that plant-based foods may improve inflammatory skin diseases by supporting the gut microbiome, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, providing barrier support, and improving glycemic control. With the proper education, there is an abundance of plant-based food sources or supplements that contain riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein, thereby ameliorating the risk of nutritional deficiencies. Thus, a plant-based diet may have therapeutic potential in dermatology. In spite of the evidence available, there is a paucity of clinical studies focusing specifically on plant-based diets and dermatologic conditions and further investigation is warranted."

This study aimed to investigate the association between three plant-based diet indexes and bone loss in 16,085 adults, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Three plant-based diet indexes (PDI, hPDI, and uPDI) were calculated from two NHANES 24-h dietary recall interviews, to characterize a plant-based diet. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Higher hPDI and PDI were associated with increased risk of bone loss (OR<sub>Q5 vs. Q1</sub> = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.24-1.81 for hPDI; OR<sub>Q5 vs. Q1</sub> = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.45 for PDI), while higher uPDI was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis (OR<sub>Q5 vs. Q1</sub> = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.04-2.11). A harmful association between plant-based diet indexes (hPDI and PDI) and osteopenia was observed at the lumbar spine rather than the femoral neck. We conducted several sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of results, including subgroup analysis, exclusion of people taking anti-osteoporotic and estrogenic drugs, further adjustment for menopausal status, corticosteroid usage, and dietary supplements, and calculation of E-value. Our study demonstrates the deleterious effects of a plant-based diet on bone health and emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet."

Therefore, it is hypothesized that adherence to a plant-based diet may have a positive effect on kidney function. The study aimed to determine the association between the plant-based diet index (PDI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used information from the Ravansar noncommunicable diseases cohort study, which included 9,746 participants between the ages of 35 and 65. By measuring the estimation glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the modification of diet in the renal disease equation, CKD was determined. Using a food frequency questionnaire, the PDI was computed based on food intake. To determine odds ratios (ORs), multivariable logistic regression models were utilized. RESULTS: 1,058 (10.86%) participants had CKD (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and the mean PDI was 54.22 ± 6.68. The mean eGFR in the group with a high PDI score was significantly higher than the group with a low PDI score (fourth quartile: 79.20 ± 0.36 vs. first quartile: 72.95 ± 0.31, P < .001). Adherence to a plant-based diet was more prevalent in those with a higher socioeconomic status (P < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of CKD in the third and fourth quartiles of PDI were 25% (OR: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.91) and 39% (OR: 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.78, P trend<.001) lower than the first quartile, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that having a plant-based diet may prevent the prevalent CDK. However, further studies with a cohort design are recommended."

However, the method has not been widely applied in studies of food intake. The aim of this article is to describe and compare the interpretation and application of different food substitution models in epidemiologic studies on diet and disease development. Both theoretically and in the context of a specific example, we discuss methodologic issues to be considered, including modeling of food substitutions using diet at a single time point or at multiple time points (focusing on dietary changes), choice of substitution unit, adjustment for total energy intake, and adjustment for confounding. We argue that specified food substitution analyses can be used to identify optimal food composition of the diet and that these analyses are thus highly relevant to inform public health policy decision makers."

            "abstract": "Nutritional epidemiology seeks to understand nutritional determinants of disease in human populations using experimental and observational study designs. Though randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence of causality, the expense and difficulty of sustaining adherence to dietary interventions are substantial barriers to investigating dietary determinants of kidney disease. Therefore, nutritional epidemiology commonly employs observational study designs, particularly prospective cohort studies, to investigate long-term associations between dietary exposures and kidney disease. Due to the covarying nature and synergistic effects of dietary components, holistic characterizations of dietary exposures that simultaneously consider patterns of foods and nutrients regularly consumed are generally more relevant to disease etiology than single nutrients or foods. Dietary intakes have traditionally been self-reported and are subject to bias. Statistical methods including energy adjustment and regression calibration can reduce random and systematic measurement errors associated with self-reported diet. Novel approaches that assess diet more objectively are gaining popularity but have not yet fully replaced self-report and require refinement and validation in populations with chronic kidney disease. More accurate and frequent diet assessment in existing and future studies will yield evidence to better personalize dietary recommendations for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence indicates that although some plant-based diets are healthful, others are not. Changes in the gut microbiome and microbiome-dependent metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), may explain differential health effects of plant-based diets. However, human data are sparse on whether qualitatively distinct types of plant-based diets differentially affect gut microbiome diversity, composition, particularly at the species level, and/or metabolites. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine cross-sectional associations of different plant-based indices with adult gut microbiome diversity, composition, and the metabolite TMAO. METHODS: We studied 705 adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with data for diet, fecal microbiome (shotgun metagenomic sequencing), and key covariates. We derived healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) using data from food frequency questionnaires. We examined plant-based diet indices with microbiome α-diversity (richness and evenness measures), β-diversity (Bray-Curtis and UniFrac measures), composition (species level), and plasma TMAO. We used regression models to determine associations before and after adjustment for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking status, body mass index, and total energy intake. RESULTS: The analytic sample (mean age, 71.0 years, SD = 12.8 years) comprised 55.6% female and 67.5% non-Hispanic White participants. hPDI was positively and uPDI negatively associated with microbiome α-diversity, driven by microbial evenness (Pielou P < 0.05). hPDI was also positively associated with relative abundance of 3 polysaccharide-degrading bacterial species (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium eligens, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and inversely associated with 6 species (Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Doreasp CAG 317, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Sellimonas intestinalis, Blautia wexlerae, and Alistipes shahii). Furthermore, hPDI was inversely associated with TMAO. Associations did not differ by age, sex, or race. CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to a healthful plant-based diet is associated with microbiome features that have been linked to positive health; adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet has opposing or null associations with these features."

Knowledge of these chronic conditions, preventative measures, and proper management tactics is important and critical to preventing disease. The overlap between obesity, diabetes, and dementia is becoming further elucidated. These conditions share a similar origin through the components of increasing age, gender, genetic and epigenetic predispositions, depression, and a high-fat Western diet (WD) that all contribute to the inflammatory state associated with the development of obesity, diabetes, and dementia. This inflammatory state leads to the dysregulation of food intake and insulin resistance. Obesity is often the cornerstone that leads to the development of diabetes and, subsequently, in the case of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), progression to \"type 3 diabetes mellitus (T3DM)\". Obesity and depression are closely associated with diabetes. However, dementia can be avoided with lifestyle modifications, by switching to a plant-based diet (e.g., a Mediterranean diet (MD)), and increasing physical activity. Diet and exercise are not the only treatment options. There are several surgical and pharmacological interventions available for prevention. Current and future research within each of these fields is warranted and offers the chance for new treatment options and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of each condition."

An overview of the data set supporting the role of the Mediterranean diet as confirmed in both observational and interventional trials should stimulate greater clinician interest in the diet. Additionally, the availability of patient-friendly tools that enable prompt and easy adoption of the Mediterranean diet, that are able to be used by clinicians who claim no special expertise in diet knowledge, should simplify the path to successful dietary change. RECENT FINDINGS: A large recently published (2018) prospective study of the Mediterranean diet for primary prevention of cardiovascular events confirmed that compared to control, Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular events in high risk patients. Of the tools available to clinicians that might reduce cardiovascular risk, dietary intervention is the one least utilized. The evidence supports the value of dietary intervention with the Mediterranean diet, and methods to effectively employ it within the confines of typical office practice are readily at hand."

            "abstract": "AIM/INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components have markedly increased worldwide. Among lifestyle factors introduced to lower the risk of MetS, healthy dietary patterns have gained considerable attention. This study aimed to assess the association between adherence to plant-based diet indices including O-PDI (overall plant-based diet index), H-PDI (healthy plant-based diet index), U-PDI (unhealthy plant-based diet index), and risk of MetS development. METHODS: To find related observational studies which assessed the association between Plant-based Diet indices and risk of MetS development, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 2016 to November 2023. A random effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). To assess the heterogeneity of included studies, the <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> index was used. RESULTS: Nine studies including 34,953 participants from the initial 288 studies were recognized to include in this meta-analysis study. According to pooled analysis, there was a significant relationship between the adherence to H-PDI and the lower risk of MetS (ES: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 77.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), while greater adherence to U-PDI was associated with 27% increases in the risk of MetS (ES: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.54; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 76.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). According to our analysis of the association between adherence to PDIs and the risk of MetS components, greater adherence to O-PDI and H-PDI was significantly associated with a higher risk of elevated FBS and obesity, respectively. As well, greater adherence to U-PDI was significantly associated with a higher risk of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C, and elevated FBS. CONCLUSION: Our results highlighted the importance of food choices in the context of a plant-based dietary pattern, indicating that adherence to unhealthy plant-based dietary patterns rich in less healthful carbohydrates may induce the risk of MetS development.

METHODS: The participants were 73,890 women in Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1984-2016), 92,352 women in NHSII (1991-2017), and 43,266 men in Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2012) without cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline. Plant-based diet quality was evaluated by the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthful PDI (hPDI), and the unhealthful PDI (uPDI). Participants who reported that their meat and/or fish intakes were 0 or <1 serving per month were categorized as vegetarians, and others were classified as nonvegetarians. Strokes with available medical records were subtyped as ischemic or hemorrhagic. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 6,241 total stroke cases (including 3,015 ischemic and 853 hemorrhagic strokes) were documented. Compared to participants with the lowest PDIs, among participants with the highest PDIs, the hazard ratios (HRs) for total stroke were 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.86-1.03) for PDI, 0.90 (0.83-0.98) for hPDI, and 1.05 (0.96-1.15) for uPDI. Participants in the highest hPDI showed marginally lower HR for ischemic stroke (0.92 [0.82-1.04]) and no consistent associations for hemorrhagic stroke. We observed no association between a vegetarian diet and total stroke (1.00 [0.76-1.32]), although the number of cases was small. CONCLUSION: Lower risk of total stroke was observed by those who adhered to a healthful plant-based diet."

Plant-based diet quality was assessed using the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthy PDI (hPDI), and unhealthy PDI (uPDI). Telomere length was measured using quantitative PCR. Linear and ordinal logistic regression models were used to assess the association of PDIs with log-transformed telomere length and ordinal quintiles of telomere length in descending order, respectively. RESULTS: In both regression models, the overall PDI was not associated with telomere length. The hPDI was associated with longer telomere length [percentage change = 2.34%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42%, 4.31%, P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.016; odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.95, P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.013]. However, uPDI was associated with shorter telomere length (percentage change = -3.17%, 95% CI: -5.65%, -0.62%, P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.017; OR = 1.25, 95% CI:1.03, 1.53, P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.014) and this inverse association was stronger in the non-Hispanic white population (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.001 in both regression models). CONCLUSIONS: A plant-based dietary pattern rich in healthy plant foods is associated with longer telomeres. However, plant-based dietary patterns rich in unhealthy plant-based foods are associated with shorter telomere lengths, especially in non-Hispanic white populations."

We performed a pooled analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate this question. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials on the effects of a plant-based diet on weight loss compared with a non-plant-based diet. In addition, a two-sample MR study was conducted. IVs were obtained from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the exposures, and we obtained summary statistics on the outcomes. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis and other MR methods were performed as supplementary analyses. RESULTS: Individuals on the plant-based diet lost more weight than the non-plant-based diet group (WMD -0.96 kg; 95% CI: -1.32 to -0.60). Population conditions and energy restriction were identified as the study-level factors that influenced the pooling results in the subgroup analyses. Increased consumption of raw vegetables was significantly associated with lower BMI (IVW, β -0.35, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.012) and lower risk of obesity (IVW, OR 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.048), coronary heart disease (IVW, OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.029) and myocardial infarction (IVW, OR 0.39,95% CI: 0.15 to 0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and a higher HDL-C (IVW, β 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.70, <i>p</i> = 4×10<sup>-5</sup>). DISCUSSION: The present findings suggest that raw vegetable intake is beneficial for weight loss and prevention of ASCVD."

            "abstract": "Traditionally, nutritional epidemiology is the study of the relationship between diet and health and disease in humans at the population level. Commonly, the exposure of interest is food intake. In recent years, nutritional epidemiology has moved from a \"black box\" approach to a systems approach where genomics, metabolomics and proteomics are providing novel insights into the interplay between diet and health. In this context, metabolomics is emerging as a key tool in nutritional epidemiology. The present review explores the use of metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology. In particular, it examines the role that food-intake biomarkers play in addressing the limitations of self-reported dietary intake data and the potential of using metabolite measurements in assessing the impact of diet on metabolic pathways and physiological processes. However, for full realisation of the potential of metabolomics in nutritional epidemiology, key challenges such as robust biomarker validation and novel methods for new metabolite identification need to be addressed. The synergy between traditional epidemiologic approaches and metabolomics will facilitate the translation of nutritional epidemiologic evidence to effective precision nutrition."

However, the association between changes in plant-based diet quality and mortality remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated the associations between 12-year changes (from 1986 to 1998) in plant-based diet quality assessed by 3 plant-based diet indices (score range, 18-90)-an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful PDI, and an unhealthful PDI-and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality (1998-2014). Participants were 49 407 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and 25 907 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) who were free from CVD and cancer in 1998. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: We documented 10 686 deaths including 2046 CVD deaths and 3091 cancer deaths in the NHS over 725 316 person-years of follow-up and 6490 deaths including 1872 CVD deaths and 1772 cancer deaths in the HPFS over 371 322 person-years of follow-up. Compared with participants whose indices remained stable, among those with the greatest increases in diet scores (highest quintile), the pooled multivariable-adjusted HRs for total mortality were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for PDI, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95) for healthful PDI, and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.18) for unhealthful PDI. Among participants with the greatest decrease (lowest quintile), the multivariable-adjusted HRs were 1.09 (95% CI, 1.04-1.15) for PDI, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.15) for healthful PDI, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.98) for unhealthful PDI. For CVD mortality, the risk associated with a 10-point increase in each PDI was 7% lower (95% CI, 1-12%) for PDI, 9% lower (95% CI, 4-14%) for healthful PDI, and 8% higher (95% CI, 2-14%) for unhealthful PDI. There were no consistent associations between changes in plant-based diet indices and cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Improving plant-based diet quality over a 12-year period was associated with a lower risk of total and CVD mortality, whereas increased consumption of an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with a higher risk of total and CVD mortality."

Ancel Keys in the 1950's showed a low mortality rate, particularly for coronary heart disease, among people resident in the Mediterranean area. The MD is characterized by the intake of the high amount of vegetables, fruit, and cereals and regular but moderate consumption of wine, fish, and dairy products, while olive oil is the main source of culinary fat. Therefore, it is principally a plant-based diet rich in polyphenols, a heterogeneous category of compounds with different properties and bioavailabilities. Among polyphenols, anthocyanins have been combined into the human food regime for centuries. They have been utilized as traditional herbal remedies for their ability to treat several conditions, as potent anti-oxidants, anti-diabetic and anti-carcinogenic compounds. This review summarizes our knowledge on the health-enhancing component of the anthocyanins-rich diet."

Specifically, some studies have pointed out that several food patterns could be associated with a reduced risk of depression among adults. This association seems to be consistent across countries, cultures and populations according to several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. Some previously described food patterns, specifically the Mediterranean Food Pattern, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, the Prudent diet or the Provegetarian Food Pattern may be effective to reduce the future risk of depression. Among them, only the Mediterranean Food Pattern has been tested for primary prevention in a large randomised trial, but the inverse association found was not statistically significant. The scientific report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee concluded that current evidence is still limited. Notwithstanding, this field is promising and, according to large and well-conducted observational studies, food patterns potentially associated with reduced risk of depression are those emphasising seafood, vegetables, fruits and nuts. There is a need to assess whether differences in the intake of some micro or macronutrients between these dietary patterns can make a difference in their association with a lower risk of depression. Moreover, the shape of the dose-response curve and the potential existence of a nonlinear threshold effect have not yet been established."

This study aimed to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes between women who followed a plant-based diet with those on an omnivore diet.

METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed electronically via social media. The survey was conducted on a population of Polish women. RESULTS: The final research group included 1015 women. The results showed that a maternal plant-based diet 6 months before pregnancy and during pregnancy does not change the incidence of GDM, anemia, and gestational hypertension. Moreover, no association was found between a diet type before conception and a delivery method or newborn birth weight. Among women who followed an omnivore diet, the risk of GDM was lower in a group with adequate physical activity during 6 months before conception (<i>p</i> = 0.0166). However, the combination of a plant-based diet with adequate activity during the preconception period did not influence GDM incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that a plant-based diet during the preconception period is not worse than an omnivore diet."

Plant-based diet quality was assessed by three plant-based diet indices: overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI) and unhealthful PDI (uPDI). Physical and mental HRQoL were measured by physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Diet was assessed 2 years before the HRQoL measurements and both were updated every 4 years. The associations between 4-year changes in PDIs and HRQoL were evaluated. Each 10-point increase in PDI was associated with an improvement of 0·07 (95 % CI 0·01, 0·13) in PCS and 0·11 (95 % CI 0·05, 0·16) in MCS. A 10-point increase in hPDI was associated with an increment of 0·13 (95 % CI 0·08, 0·19) in PCS and 0·09 (95 % CI 0·03, 0·15) in MCS. Conversely, a 10-point increase in uPDI was associated with decreases in PCS and MCS (-0·07 (95 % CI -0·12, -0·02) and -0·10 (95 % CI -0·16, -0·05), respectively). Compared with a stable diet, an increase in hPDI was significantly associated with improvements in physical HRQoL in older women and with mental HRQoL in younger women. In conclusion, adherence to a healthful plant-based diet was modestly associated with improvements in both physical and mental dimensions of HRQoL."

Although the pathophysiology of CVD and cancer is complex and multifactorial, lifestyle factors including diet often contribute significantly to their pathogenesis. There is a wealth of observational data as well as emerging trial data supporting the benefits of a predominantly whole-food plant-based diet in the prevention of CVD and cancer. However, there is a need for implementation science to effectuate existing knowledge. Given the shortcomings of the standard American diet, characterized by excessive intake of red meat and ultraprocessed foods, while deficient in fiber and phytonutrients, it will be necessary to shift default patterns of eating to make healthy choices the path of least resistance."

Waist circumference (WC) was used to define abdominal obesity. The 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were applied to estimate depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multi-adjusted binary logistic regression models were conducted to explore the effects of the three plant-based diet indices, abdominal obesity status, and their interaction on depression and anxiety. We enrolled a total of 11,623 participants aged 83.21 ± 10.98 years, of which 3140 (27.0%) participants had depression and 1361 (11.7%) had anxiety. The trend in the prevalence of depression/anxiety across increasing quartiles of the plant-based diet indices was statistically significant after controlling for potential confounders (<i>p</i>-trend < 0.05). Abdominal obesity was related to a lower prevalence of depression (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.95) and anxiety (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69-0.90) compared with non-abdominal obesity. The protective effects of the PDI and hPDI against depression (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.41-0.64; OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.48-0.73, respectively) and anxiety (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57-1.00; OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.39-0.70, respectively) were more pronounced in non-abdominally obese participants. The harmful effects of the uPDI against depression (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.42-2.23) and anxiety (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.16-2.10) were more pronounced in non-abdominally obese participants. In addition, a significant interaction between the plant-based diet indices and abdominal obesity was observed in terms of causing the prevalence of depression and anxiety. Consuming more of a healthful plant-based diet and less of an animal-based diet is related to a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. A healthful plant-based diet plays a vital role in non-abdominally obese individuals."

One of the reforms he proposes is to conduct analyses that take into account the \"totality for all nutritional factors measured\". This approach is based on isolating and reducing diet into numerous independent variables with little regard to prior knowledge or the interrelations among dietary components, and relying on a \"discovery\" approach. This method, akin to genomewide association studies (GWAS), would involve very large sample sizes, small associations, no prior knowledge, and multiple testing considerations. This method is contrary to the more traditional hypothesis generating and testing approach built on all types of evidence. This commentary will contrast how suitable these two approaches are to study diet and disease."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on demographics, diet, and testosterone levels was acquired from the NHANES database. Using the food frequency questionnaire, an overall plant-based diet index (PDI) and a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) was developed. A higher score on PDI and hPDI indicates higher consumption of plant foods. RESULTS: A total of 191 participants were included, average age was 45 (30-60) years and average total testosterone level was 546.7 ± 254.7 ng/dL. The mean PDI and hPDI were 50.4 ± 6 and 50.8 ± 7.2, respectively. On multiple linear regression analysis, BMI and age significantly contribute to testosterone levels (p < 0.05); however, neither of the diet indexes significantly predicted serum testosterone levels (PDI: p = 0.446; and hPDI: p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: In a well characterized national database, the plant-based diet index is unable to predict testosterone levels. Plant-based food content in diet is not associated with serum testosterone levels."

A plant-based diet index (PDI) differentiating between a healthful, unhealthful, and overall PBD, offers a promising approach to standardize and compare studies and integrate results. In this review we (1) summarize current evidence on the PDI and disease risk of relevance to public health, (2) discuss the methodology of the PDI and how it can be sensibly applied in further studies and (3) indicate areas with a lack of knowledge, such as vulnerable populations. In summary, our amalgamation shows, that adherence to a healthier plant-based diet is associated with an 8-68% lower risk for metabolic risk factors, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, while adherence to an unhealthier plant-based diet is associated with a 10-63% higher risk. Although differences in calculation methods and underlying diet patterns between populations should be accounted for, the PDI can be a useful tool to assess adherence to different plant-based diet patterns and their association with health outcomes in cohort studies across cultures."

We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the presence of lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet in hypertensive subjects and analyze the correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records and collected the data of the patients admitted to our Internal Medicine ward from 2010 to 2020 with a discharge diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to the NCEP ATP-III criteria. We divided patients in two groups: hypertensive and no hypertensive. The Mediterranean Diet Score was used to evaluate the consumption and frequency of the foods characterizing a Mediterranean-type diet. RESULTS: Hypertensive patients were older (73 ± 11.5 vs. 57.2 ± 5.7; p < 0.0005) and had a higher mean BMI (29.9 ± 5.2 vs. 25 ± 2.4, p < 0.0005) compared to control group. The degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, evaluated by the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), was significantly higher in the control group than in the hypertensive group (3.8 ± 1.6 vs 6.9 ± 1.5; p < 0.0005). Various comorbidities were more prevalent in hypertensives, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and chronic renal failure. Lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and PAD/carotid atherosclerosis, and significantly worse lipid profiles. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a lower adherence to a Mediterranean Diet Style is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk factor profile in hypertensive patients. Thus, Mediterranean diet adherence in hypertensive subjects is associated with a wider cardiometabolic scenario."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrate that consuming plant-based diets has beneficial effects on several health outcomes. However, the evaluation of the healthiness of plant-based diets and the incidence of hypertension has still been little explored in the literature. OBJECTIVES: Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the association between plant-based diet indices and the incidence of hypertension in Brazilian adults and test whether the interaction between hPDI, sociodemographic, and lifestyle variables modifies this association. METHODS: This longitudinal study included 3192 (F = 2125, average age 34 years) participants from the Cohort of Universities of Minas Gerais (CUME Study, Brazil, 2016-2022). Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We measured three plant-based diet indices: overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). Participants were classified as new cases of hypertension if they were free of this disease at baseline, had a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, were using antihypertensive medications, or had a diagnosis of hypertension by a physician in at least one of the follow-ups. Crude and adjusted Cox regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between plant-based diet indices and hypertension incidence and a multiplicative interaction was tested. RESULTS: The incidence of hypertension was 19,8/1000 person-years total. The mean follow-up time was 3.36 years. There was an inverse association between the highest quintiles of hPDI (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.37-0.86; HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35-0.88) and hypertension. In subgroup analysis, inverse associations between hPDI and hypertension risk were stronger in participants who were insufficiently active and overweight (p-interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Greater consumption of healthful plant foods, reduced consumption of animal-source foods, and less consumption of unhealthful plant foods are important for hypertension prevention in the Brazilian population."

Such diseases spread among people through contact with contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, or blood products, or through the air, insect bites, or consuming contaminated food and beverages. Although some communicable diseases can be treated or prevented by taking medication and vaccines, there has been an increase in awareness of adopting a healthy diet to aid in the prevention and reversal of these diseases. One popular diet is a plant-based diet. Plant-based diets generally consist of vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fruits, without any animal-source foods or artificial ingredients. Over the years, this diet has continuously increased in popularity. Reasons for following a plant-based diet are varied but include health benefits, such as improving immunity, and reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Scientific evidence even shows that just an increased vegetable intake can decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases caused by viruses, such as hepatitis viruses, and reduce the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. Therefore, this mini review discusses the effectiveness of adopting a plant-based diet in ameliorating diseases caused by selected viruses and its limitations."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a plant-based diet intervention. Secondly, the purpose was to investigate whether such diet may reduce disease activity and enhance quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a single arm feasibility study. Outpatients with Crohn's disease in biological therapy were guided over twelve weeks towards a dietary lifestyle change. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility concerning recruitment, retention rate and compliance. Secondary outcomes were measures of patient reported outcome questionnaires (PROMS). Paired t-tests were used to examine changes in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, anthropology, biomarkers, and patient-reported data. Δ-values were used to investigate difference between dietary intake and requirements. Linear regression analyses examined the association between biomarkers and PROMS. RESULTS: In total, 15 participants completed the intervention with easy recruitment and a retention rate at 87.6%. A clinically positive tendency was seen towards improved symptom scores for disease (HBI; p=0.028 and IBDQ; p=0.006) but not for fatigue (IBD-F; p = 0.097), although none of these were statistically significant. Adverse effects were decreased protein intake (p=0.069) and slightly reduced muscle mass. It remains unclear to what extent the intervention contributed to the improved self-reported effects although perception of disease activity was improved. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that it is possible to retain patients following a plant-based diet. However, the dietary change required ongoing dietetic support with a focus on anti-inflammatory agents and the still unattainable protein requirements."

The nationwide cohort study included 10 059 adults aged 65 and older from the 2008-2018 waves of the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey (CLHLS). Dietary intake was collected using a simplified food frequency questionnaire and used to calculate the plant-based diet index (PDI). Arthritis was defined as participants self-reporting suffering from arthritis. Time-dependent Cox regression model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of arthritis.

During a median follow-up period of 4.2 years, 1482 participants who were free of arthritis at baseline reported arthritis. The highest quality of plant-based diet was associated with a 16.0% decrease in the risk of suffering from arthritis (HR: 0.840, 95% CI: 0.757, 0.932). Interaction analysis showed that participants with a high PDI and exercise had a significantly lower risk of arthritis. Stratified analysis showed that the association between PDI and arthritis was significant among participants living in rural areas. <i>Conclusions</i>. Greater adherence to a plant-based diet may help delay the onset of arthritis symptoms. Promoting plant-based dietary patterns may be a strategy to reduce arthritis incidence and improve healthy life expectancy."

However, less is known regarding the impact of plant-based diets on quality of life among individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. The authors' objective was to examine the relationship between plant-based diet indices postdiagnosis with quality of life. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 3505 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016) with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Food-frequency questionnaires were used to calculate overall and healthful plant-based diet indices. Quality-of-life scores were calculated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations over time between plant-based diet indices and quality-of-life domains (sexual functioning, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, bowel functioning, hormonal/vitality), adjusted for demographics, oncologic history, body mass index, caloric intake, health-related behaviors, and comorbidities. RESULTS: The median age at prostate cancer diagnosis was 68 years; 48% of patients underwent radical prostatectomy, and 35% received radiation as primary therapy. The median time from diagnosis/treatment to first the quality-of-life questionnaire was 7.0 years. A higher plant-based diet index was associated with better scores for sexual function, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, and hormonal/vitality. Consuming more healthful plant-based foods was also associated with better sexual and bowel function, as well as urinary incontinence and hormonal/vitality scores in the age-adjusted analysis, but not in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study provides supportive evidence that greater consumption of healthful plant-based foods is associated with modestly higher scores in quality-of-life domains among patients with prostate cancer."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore the potential health effects of increasing the proportion of whole plant-based foods within a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), summarize the available evidence, and provide recommendations for future research on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Replacing animal-based foods by whole plant-based foods may enhance the health benefits of diets. Beyond evidence on individual food substitutions, an emerging body of literature points out that adopting a plant-forward Mediterranean diet may further amplify the positive health effects of the overall dietary pattern. Additionally, although the MedDiet is recognized as an environmentally sustainable pattern, a fully plant-based version could further reduce its environmental impact and resource use compared to an omnivorous diet. The MedDiet is widely recognized for its health benefits, particularly in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions. These benefits are largely attributed to its emphasis on whole, plant-based foods. Although evidence is limited, current findings suggest that reducing the animal-based content of the traditional MedDiet, along with the increase in whole plant-based food, could lead to enhanced health benefits. Furthermore, the reduction in environmental pollution and resources overused could contribute to broader public health and sustainability. Long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative health effects of these dietary patterns."

METHODS: The score was developed as an adaptation of the dietary portfolio for cholesterol reduction, assigning one point for adherence to seven dietary indicators and ranging from 0 (null adherence) to 7 (highest adherence). The score was calculated for breast cancer patients enrolled in the DEDiCa study using a 7-day food record; serum lipid profile, including total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), was evaluated in serum at baseline. RESULTS: Patients with the highest adherence to the cholesterol-lowering diet (i.e., score ≥ 4) reported lower LDL-C level than women with score 0-1 (median: 107 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.01). The proportion of women with LDL-C above the recommended limit of 116 mg/dL was 60.0% with score 0-1 and 42.6% with score ≥4. Although the score directly correlates with consumption of foods from vegetal sources, it was mildly associated with the healthful plant-based diet index (r-Spearman = 0.51) and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (r-Spearman = 0.30) Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence that the cholesterol-lowering diet score is capable of detecting a specific plant-based dietary pattern that affects circulating cholesterol levels."

However, existing analytic methods of dietary data are often sub-optimal, with limited incorporation and analysis of the correlations between the studied variables and nonlinear behaviours in the data. Machine learning (ML) is an area of artificial intelligence that has the potential to improve modelling of nonlinear associations and confounding which are found in nutritional data. These opportunities notwithstanding, the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology must be approached cautiously to safeguard the scientific quality of the results and provide accurate interpretations. Given the complex scenario around ML, judicious application of such tools is necessary to offer nutritional epidemiology a novel analytical resource for dietary measurement and assessment and a tool to model the complexity of dietary intake and its relation to health. This work describes the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology and provides guidelines to avoid common pitfalls encountered in applying predictive statistical models to nutritional data. Furthermore, it helps unfamiliar readers better assess the significance of their results and provides new possible future directions in the field of ML in nutritional epidemiology."

            "abstract": "This review explores the multifaceted relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer outcomes, focusing on unsaturated fats, the Mediterranean diet (MD), and other nutritional components. Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with lifestyle factors like diet playing a pivotal role in prevention and management. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Articles written in English and released between 2019 and 2024 were acceptable. We used pertinent search terms such as \"unsaturated fats\", \"Mediterranean diet\", \"breast cancer\", and \"nutrition\" to perform searches in PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), EBSCOhost, and grey literature such as Google Scholar. After screening, 11 of the 479 original papers were chosen and included in the final review. These include cross-sectional analysis and systematic review, cohort study, narrative review, systematic review and meta-analysis, case-control study, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and cross-sectional study. Key findings suggest that adherence to the MD correlates with improved quality of life measures and reduced mortality rates among women with breast cancer, particularly in older age groups. The diet's emphasis on antioxidant-rich foods, anti-inflammatory compounds, and healthy fats contributes to these observed benefits. Specific unsaturated fats, notably omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), demonstrate anti-cancer properties by modulating cancer cell behavior and enhancing treatment responses. Biomarkers associated with the MD, such as β-carotene and lycopene, serve as indicators of dietary compliance and potential risk reduction. Furthermore, components found in olive oil, including polyphenols and monounsaturated fatty acids, exhibit promising effects in preventing breast cancer by exerting antioxidant and anti-proliferative actions. Other dietary factors like calcium, legumes, fruits, and vegetables also play a role in reducing breast cancer risk and improving survival rates. This review underscores the importance of dietary interventions in optimizing outcomes for breast cancer patients and highlights the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and refine dietary recommendations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although Spain has traditionally followed the Mediterranean diet, in recent years, changes have become noticeable in the food preferences of the population. These changes include adopting new diets and dietary trends, such as plant-based diets, intermittent fasting and raw food diets. These choices are influenced by cultural, social and socio-demographic factors, and their impact on health should be studied in detail. AIM: The objectives of this research are: (1) to study the prevalence of different dietary patterns among the Spanish population, (2) to explore the dependence of dietary choice on socio-demographic factors, (3) to investigate the relationship between the social habits and lifestyle choices of the population and how it affects health. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on the Spanish population. Using a questionnaire constructed and validated by the research team, socio-demographic data were collected and different nutritional, social and lifestyle habits of the targeted population were explored. RESULTS: A valid sample of 22,181 people was collected among which 17,573 (79.2%) people claimed to follow a Mediterranean dietary pattern, 1,425 (6.4%) people followed a plant-based diet, 365 (1.6%) people are vegans, 1,018 people (4.6%) practiced intermittent fasting, 252 (1.1%) people followed a raw food diet and 1,548 people (7%) claimed to follow other types of diets. The data show that younger people (18-25 years old) tend to adopt more often a plant-based diet than older people and that women tend to follow this type of diet more often than men. On the other hand, men seem to practice intermittent fasting more frequently. A higher tendency to practice a raw food diet was found among people living in villages than those living in cities. Moreover, some trends were found in different regions of Spain, with greater adherence to a plant-based diet in Catalonia, while intermittent fasting is more common in the Region of Murcia. Finally, the results indicate that individuals who pay attention to their diet and experiment with various dietary patterns are generally more health-conscious. This is reflected in their adoption of healthier behaviors, such as exercising more and reducing their intake of alcohol and sugary drinks."

Discussion of nutrition and the benefits of a plant-based diet should be highlighted during healthcare provider visits as an essential part of the overall CVD prevention and management care plan. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence from prospective cohort studies indicates that a high consumption of predominantly plant-based foods, such as fruit and vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, is associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD. The protective effects of these foods are likely mediated through their multiple beneficial nutrients, including mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, fiber, and plant protein. In addition, minimizing intake of animal proteins has been shown to decrease the prevalence of CVD risk factors. Substantial evidence indicates that plant-based diets can play an important role in preventing and treating CVD and its risk factors. Such diets deserve more emphasis in dietary recommendations."

            "abstract": "Nutritional epidemiology has an important role, as it can provide long-term data from large populations and does not rely on surrogate markers for morbidity/mortality. Meaningful interpretation and applications of outcomes from epidemiological studies depend on the accurate assessment of dietary intake, which is currently mainly based on a combination of self-reporting and food composition data. Flavan-3-ols are a group of bioactives (non-essential dietary components with significant impact on health) that is a possible candidate for the development of dietary recommendations. The breadth of data available on their effect on health also provides the basis for investigating the suitability of the methods currently used in nutritional epidemiology to assess the health effects of bioactives. The outcomes of this assessment demonstrate that the limitations of currently used methods make it virtually impossible to estimate intake accurately from self-reported dietary data. This is due to the limitations of self-reporting, especially from food-frequency questionnaires, and the inability of currently used methods to deal with the high variability of food composition. Indeed, the estimated intake of flavan-3-ols, can only be interpreted as a marker of specific dietary patterns, but not as the actual intake amount. The interpretation of results from such studies are fraught with serious limitations, especially for establishing associations between intake and health and the development of dietary recommendations. Alternative assessment not affected by these limitations, such as biomarkers, are required to overcome these limitations. The development of nutritional biomarkers is therefore crucial to investigate the health effect of bioactives."

Some of the risk factors include social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing with soap, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and dysbiosis. Evidence has shown the incidence of total infection and death rates to be lower in sub-Saharan Africa when compared with North Africa, Europe and North America and many other parts of the world. The higher the metabolic syndrome rate, the higher the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Africa has a lower rate of metabolic syndrome risk than many other continents. This paradox has puzzled several in the biomedical and scientific communities. Published results of research have demonstrated the exciting correlation that the combination of young age of the population coupled with their native plant-based diet has lowered their risk factors. The plant-based diet include whole grains (millet, sorghum), legumes (black-eye peas, dry beans, soybean), vegetables, potato, sweet potato, yams, squash, banana, pumpkin seeds, and moringa leaves, and lower consumption of meat. The plant-based diet results in a different gut microbiota than of most of the rest of the world. This has a significant impact on the survival rate of other populations. The \"plant-based diet\" results in lower rates of obesity, diabetes and dysbiosis, which could contribute to lower and less severe infections. However, these hypotheses need to be supported by more clinical and biostatistics data."

We used keywords, such as \"hypertension,\" \"nutrition,\" \"nutritional management,\" \"nutrient intake,\" \"dietary strategies,\" \"DASH diet,\" \"Mediterranean diet,\" and related terms. Hypertension, a grave global health concern, affects more than one billion people worldwide. Lifestyle modifications, including nutritional strategies, are important in non-pharmacological interventions. Dietary patterns, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) and Mediterranean diets, which emphasize fruit and vegetable consumption, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure. Certain nutrients, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium, have significant effects on blood pressure. The mechanisms underlying these dietary strategies include vasodilation, improvement in endothelial function, regulation of sodium balance, and mitigation of oxidative stress. However, successful implementation of these strategies can be hindered by various factors, such as adherence challenges, socioeconomic disparities, and cultural preferences. In conclusion, robust evidence supports the effectiveness of nutritional strategies in the management of hypertension. DASH and Mediterranean diets, along with an increased intake of specific nutrients, contribute to blood pressure reduction. Hence, comprehensive lifestyle modifications, with a focus on nutritional changes, are recommended as primary or complementary treatments for hypertension. Addressing the identified barriers could enhance the efficacy and use of these dietary approaches in clinical practice."

Differences between the two populations with regard to the foods that are available, food processing and preparation techniques, and eating and lifestyle habits may influence the implementation and effects of a Mediterranean diet in non-Mediterranean regions. For example, the composition of food groups may vary significantly, due to differences in the specific foods within a food group and to differences in aspects of food production and preparation. Notable differences between the diets of Mediterranean versus non-Mediterranean populations include the source of monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil versus meat), the amount of vegetables consumed and their manner of preparation, the source of alcohol (wine versus other) and the pattern of intake, and the types of meat and dairy products consumed. Lifestyle factors such as meal patterns and exposure to sunlight may also act as confounding factors when the overall benefits of a Mediterranean diet are assessed. Improving the calculation of Mediterranean diet scores and measuring plasma nutrient levels may help mitigate the effects of confounders. These considerations could have important health implications when a Mediterranean diet is implemented by non-Mediterranean populations."

Three different plant-based diet indices (overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI)), were calculated. Dyslipidaemia and its components (hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, use of anti-hyperlipidaemia agent) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between plant-based diet and dyslipidaemia and individual lipid disorders. Totally, 47% of overall population had dyslipidaemia. Individual in the highest quintile of uPDI had 22% greater odds of dyslipidaemia (95 % CI 1·05, 1·41) and 48 % higher odds of hypertriacylglycerolaemia (95 % CI 1·21, 1·81) and 16% higher odds of low HDL-cholesterol (OR: 1·16, 95 % CI 1·00, 1·35) than those in the lowest quintile of uPDI. PDI was associated with 16 % higher odds of low HDL-cholesterol, and hPDI was associated with 25% lower odds of high LDL-cholesterol. However, neither PDI nor hPDI was significantly associated with the prevalence of dyslipidaemia. Greater adherence to unhealthful plant-based diets was associated with greater odds of the dyslipidaemia and its components suggesting the importance of the quality of plant-based diet in South Korean adults for dyslipidaemia prevention."

AIM: We aimed to examine the relationship between plant-based diet indices and metabolic syndrome. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 178 older adults (51 men and 127 women), with a mean age of 67.04 (60-83) who were referred to health centers in Tehran, Iran. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We created an overall plant-based diet index, healthful plant-based diet index, and unhealthful plant-based diet index from semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire data. Anthropometric measures were done. RESULTS: Our crude model results showed that triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and waist circumference did not significantly differ between tertiles of plant-based diet index and healthful plant-based diet index; also triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and waist circumference did not significantly differ between tertiles of unhealthful plant-based diet index, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly differed between tertiles of unhealthful plant-based diet index. After adjusting for confounders the results remained non-significant for plant-based diet index but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significant for healthful and unhealthful plant-based diet indices. There was also no significant association between plant-based diet index (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.53-2.33), healthful plant-based diet index (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.39-1.68), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.38-1.72) with metabolic syndrome, even after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that plant-based diets are not significantly associated with risk of metabolic syndrome in older adults. To confirm the veracity of these findings, more studies should be conducted."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutritional epidemiology is the assessment of diet and its relationship to disease aetiology in populations. The choice of dietary assessment method depends on the disease pathology. Events such as cancer that are chronic and complicated by exposure time require methods that capture consumption patterns of populations over a period of years. Although several methods of dietary assessment exist for collecting information on groups of individuals, their application to epidemiologic studies requires an understanding of the effect of variability in nutrient intake, sources of measurement error, and statistical issues unique to the study of nutritional epidemiology. AIM: This review provides an overview of commonly-used methods of dietary assessments in epidemiologic studies, and identifies their strengths and limitations and application to epidemiologic study designs. It concludes with a brief discussion of assumptions of nutrient databases and objectives of energy-adjustment and measurement error correction models. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional epidemiology has contributed significantly to our understanding of the relationships between diet and disease. Ongoing investigations that further characterize important exposure periods (early life, in utero) and clarify associations within the context of genetic susceptibility will continue to elucidate our understanding of the pathophysiology of complex diseases, and support future recommendations for disease prevention."

Causality inference in nutritional epidemiology is largely based on evidence from studies of observational design, and may be distorted by unmeasured or residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization is a recently developed methodology that combines genetic and classical epidemiological analysis to infer causality for environmental exposures, based on the principle of Mendel's law of independent assortment. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures of interest. Associations derived from Mendelian randomization analysis are less likely to be affected by confounding and reverse causation. During the past 5 years, a body of studies examined the causal effects of diet/lifestyle factors and biomarkers on a variety of diseases. The Mendelian randomization approach also holds considerable promise in the study of intrauterine influences on offspring health outcomes. However, the application of Mendelian randomization in nutritional epidemiology has some limitations."

This study aimed to investigate how adherence to a plant-based diet influences the risk of CRC in this understudied population. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in the CRC surgery departments of general hospitals in Tehran, Iran. A total of 71 individuals with newly diagnosed CRC (cases) and 142 controls subjects free of cancer and acute illness were concurrently recruited from the same hospital. Dietary information was collected using a semi-quantitative 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were characterized using the plant-based diet index (PDI), unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI) and healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI). Multivariate logistic regression was employed to assess the association between these dietary patterns and the risk of CRC. RESULTS: After adjusting the potential confounders, the risk of CRC was significantly lower in the highest tertile of hPDI compared to the lowest tertile (odds ratio (OR) = 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.56, representing 79% risk reduction). Conversely, the risk of CRC was significantly higher in the highest tertile of uPDI compared to the lowest tertile (OR = 6.76; 95% CI: 2.41-18.94). PDI was no significant associated with the risk of CRC. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that higher scores on the hPDI was significantly associated with a decrease risk of CRC, while greater adherence to the uPDI contributed to a significantly increase risk."

We have previously shown that the plant-derived isoflavonoid genistein is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation and in vitro angiogenesis. Moreover, the concentration of genistein in the urine of subjects consuming a plant-based diet is 30-fold higher than that in subjects consuming a traditional Western diet. We have also reported that certain structurally related flavonoids are more potent inhibitors than genistein. Indeed, 3-hydroxyflavone, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, 2',3'-dihydroxyflavone, fisetin, apigenin and luteolin inhibit the proliferation of normal and tumour cells as well as in vitro angiogenesis at half-maximal concentrations in the lower micromolar range. The wide distribution of isoflavonoids and flavonoids in the plant kingdom, together with their anti-angiogenic and anti-mitotic properties, suggest that these phytoestrogens may contribute to the preventive effect of a plant-based diet on chronic diseases, including solid tumours."

However, whether there is an association between plant-based diet and ED is remains to be explored. Thus, we conducted the nested case-control study to investigate the relationship between the plant-based diet and ED in China. RESULTS: ED group (92 subjeczts) and ED free group (92 subjects) were similar in terms of basic features (P > 0.05), except for lifestyle (P < 0.05). The plant-diet index (PDI) and healthy plant-diet index (hPDI) in the ED group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.001). Adjusted multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of ED was negatively associated with nitric oxide levels, PDI, and hPDI (all P < 0.05), and was positively related to body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and E-selectin levels. Furthermore, both the PDI and hPDI increased significantly as the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores increased within the ED group (P < 0.05). Multi-model multivariate analysis indicated the robustness of results. CONCLUSIONS: More plant-based diet intake was associated with a reduced presence of ED and less severe ED in China. Committing to plant-based diet can be encouraged for many health benefits and to lower ED burden. Further well-designed studies are warranted to validate our findings."

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the combination of food quantity and quality along with genetic susceptibility are able to induce the aberrant activation of innate immune signalling, which initially contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation. Liver represents the central player to inflammatory response. Dietary/metabolic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the main causes of liver disease in the Western world. Enlargement of the spleen, central organ in regulating the inflammation-related immune response, is commonly seen in patients with of NAFLD, depicting the so called \"liver-spleen axis.\" The aim of this review was to provide an at-a-glance overview of the possible bi-directional mechanisms linking nutrition and inflammation, particularly pinpointing the inflammatory effects stemmed by nutrition on \"liver-spleen axis.\" In particular, the role of unhealthy diet, healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet style, dietary vitamins and micronutrients, such as vitamin D or Magnesium, and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1, a well-known incretin released in response to meal intake, will be discussed. The highly variability of the inflammatory response highlights the role of expert nutritionists in refining methodologies apt to assess nutritional epidemiology and to apply appropriate dietary intervention to counteract diet-induced inflammation mechanisms."

Recent research efforts have shifted to evaluating the role that modifiable risk factors play in cancer risk and development, as diet and nutrition have been found to play a significant role in the onset and progression of cancer. As a result, there has been an increasing focus on the impact of dietary modifications on preventing the onset, progression, and reoccurrence of cancer. In this systematic review, data were collected on three common diets, the Mediterranean diet (MD), ketogenic diet (KD), and plant-based diet, to gain insight into the application of these three dietary modification approaches for risk prevention and limitation of cancer burden. Initially, 4,397 articles were identified from three databases (Ovid, Web of Science, and CINHAL). After removing studies based on the exclusion criteria, only 23 studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review of which 15 evaluated the MD, four assessed the ketogenic diet, and four evaluated the plant-based diet. Each article was considered for its methods, procedures, and findings. The findings indicate that dietary interventions may effectively reduce the odds of cancer development and the advancement of diagnosed cancers. With the introduction of the MD, KD, and plant-based diets, significant improvements in lowering cancer development, recurrence-free status, and limiting tumor growth were noted across numerous cancer types. Currently, the MD has been extensively studied in the literature, and amongst the widest variety of cancer types. Additional information and evaluation are required on the ketogenic and plant-based diets to fully understand their impact on the cancer burden across a wider subset of cancers. Clinicians should evaluate and recommend nutritional adaptations to their patients to limit the development of specific cancers and as an adjunctive therapy to traditional pharmacological treatment options for patients with diagnosed cancers."

Research has consistently favoured the Mediterranean diet as a cardio-protective diet. Several studies have evaluated associations between the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular outcomes, including traditional risk factors like hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. In addition, consistent evidence suggests that the components of the Mediterranean diet have a synergistic effect on cardiovascular risk due to its anti-inflammatory profile and microbiome effects. While the benefits of the Mediterranean diet are well-established, health advice and dietary guidelines have been built on largely male-dominant studies. Few studies have investigated the beneficial associations of the Mediterranean diet in sex-specific populations, including those with non-traditional risk factors that are specific to women, for instance polycystic ovarian syndrome and high-risk pregnancies, or more prevalent in women, such as chronic inflammatory diseases. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the Mediterranean diet in women in relation to cardiovascular health outcomes."

METHODS: The study included 2424 participants aged 45 years and older. Dietary data were collected using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale. Plant-based diet was categorized based on 3 indices (score range, 17-85) covering 17 food groups: the overall plant-based diet index, healthful plant-based diet index, and unhealthful plant-based diet index. The associations between these plant-based diet indices and sleep quality were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and multiple disease-related factors, participants in the highest quartile of the healthful plant-based diet index had 0.55 higher odds of better sleep quality (95% CI: 0.42, 0.72; P<sub>trend</sub>< .001). In contrast, participants in the highest quartile of the unhealthful plant-based diet index had 2.03 higher odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.51, 2.72; P<sub>trend</sub>< .001). In addition, plant-based diet index and healthful plant-based diet index were inversely associated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, while unhealthful plant-based diet index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were positively associated. CONCLUSIONS: We found unhealthy plant-based diets are significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Adherence to overall plant-based diets, especially healthy plant-based diets, was positively associated with optimal sleep quality."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI) is associated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic conditions, but its association as well as interactions with microbiome have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the interrelations between hPDI, gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic risk markers. METHODS: hPDI was derived from dietary assessments by a validated FFQ and was examined in relation to metagenomic profiles of 911 fecal samples collected from 303 men aged 71 ± 4 y with an average BMI (in kg/m2) of 25.2 ± 3.6 in the Men's Lifestyle Validation Study. Principal coordinate (PCo) analysis based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was conducted, and interactions between hPDI and PCo were examined by using a metabolic risk score composed of blood lipids, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, hPDI was significantly associated with the relative abundance of 7 species and 9 pathways. In particular, higher hPDI was significantly associated with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Eubacterium eligens, amino acid biosynthesis pathways (l-isoleucine biosynthesis I and III and l-valine biosynthesis), and the pathway of pyruvate fermentation to isobutanol. A favorable association between hPDI and the metabolic risk score was more pronounced among men with a higher PCo characterized by higher abundance of Bacteroides uniformis and lower abundance of Prevotella copri. At the individual species level, a similar interaction was also observed between hPDI and P. copri, as well as with Clostridium clostridioforme or Blautia hydrogenotrophica (all P-interaction < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A greater adherence to a healthy plant-based diet by older men was associated with a microbial profile characterized by a higher abundance of multiple species, including B. cellulosilyticus and E. eligens, as well as pathways in amino acid metabolism and pyruvate fermentation. In addition, inverse associations between healthy plant-based diet and human metabolic risk may partially depend on microbial compositions."

            "abstract": "Within the last decades, plant-based diets have received increasing interest for their potential benefits to human and environmental health. The concept of plant-based diet, however, varies widely in its definition. Current definitions range from the exclusion of all animal products to diets that include meat, fish, and dairy in varying quantities. Therefore, the main objectives of this review were twofold: (a) to investigate how researchers use the term plant-based diet in nutrition intervention studies and (b) what types of food a plant-based diet may include. Searching two databases, we found that the term \"plant-based diet\" evokes varying ideas to researchers and clinicians. Fifty percent of the retrieved studies that included a plant-based dietary intervention completely proscribed animal products and used the term plant-based diet interchangeably with a vegan diet. In contrast, an ~33% of trials included dairy products and 20% of dietary interventions emphasized a semi-vegetarian dietary pattern. Based on specific examples, we point out how the usage of the umbrella term \"plant-based diet\" may cause significant ambiguity. We often encountered incomplete descriptions of plant-based dietary interventions, which makes comparison and reproducibility of studies difficult. As a consequence, we urge others to use the term \"plant-based diet\" only in conjunction with a detailed dietary description. To facilitate this process, we provide a template of a standardized plant-based intervention reporting checklist. Finally, the present review also highlights the urgent need for a consensus definition of the term plant-based diet and its content."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diet is one of the main modulators of the gut microbiota, and dietary patterns are decisive for gut-microbiota-related diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The low-FODMAP diet (LFD) is commonly used to treat IBS, but its long-term effects on microbiota, symptoms and quality of life (QoL) are unclear. Alternative dietary strategies promoting beneficial gut microbiota, combined with reduced symptoms and improved QoL, are therefore of interest. AIMS: To review current evidence on the diet-microbiota-interaction as a modulator of IBS pathophysiology, and dietary management of IBS, with particular emphasis on strategies targeting the gut microbiota, beyond the LFD. METHODS: Literature was identified through PubMed-searches with relevant keywords. RESULTS: Dietary patterns with a low intake of processed foods and a high intake of plants, such as the Mediterranean diet, promote gut microbiota associated with beneficial health outcomes. In contrast, Western diets with a high intake of ultra-processed foods promote a microbiota associated with disease, including IBS. Increasing evidence points towards dietary strategies consistent with the Mediterranean diet being equal to the LFD in alleviating IBS-symptoms and having a less negative impact on QoL. Timing of food intake is suggested as a gut microbiota modulator, but little is known about its effects on IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary recommendations in IBS should aim to target the gut microbiota by focusing on improved dietary quality, considering the impact on both IBS-symptoms and QoL. Increased intake of whole foods combined with a regular meal pattern and limitation of ultra-processed foods can be beneficial strategies beyond the LFD."

The brain-gut-microbiota axis has been described as a new paradigm for advancing understanding and treatment of the disorder. There is now over-whelming evidence to support the fact that gut microbes have a major impact on central neurochemistry and behaviour, especially stress related disorders such as depression. Recent studies indicate that patients with depression have a gut dysbiosis. The reason for this dysbiosis is uncertain. Over recent decades, dietary patterns in Europe and elsewhere have undergone major compositional changes, with increased intakes of red meat, high fat foods, and refined sugars. Individuals who consume a Mediterranean diet have lower rates of depression and a recent study suggests that a Mediterranean diet may have antidepressant properties. Assuming this to be the case, which components of the Mediterranean diet mediate the effects? Highly levels of polyphenols or polyunsaturated fatty acids are obvious candidates. We in the MyNewGut consortium recommend that patients with depression or vulnerability to depression should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of grains/fibres and fish."

However, data on their effect on end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are limited. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of Mediterranean, DASH, and plant-based diets on outcomes among ESKD patients. METHODS: A literature review was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from inception through September 2022 to identify studies that assess the clinical outcomes of Mediterranean, DASH, or plant-based diets on ESKD patients on hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Effect estimates from the individual studies were derived utilizing the random-effect, generic inverse variance approach of DerSimonian and Laird. RESULTS: Seven studies with 9400 ESKD patients (8395 HD and 1005 PD) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the data analysis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) of mortality for ESKD patients who adhered to the Mediterranean versus plant-based diet were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.07-3.54; two studies, I<sup>2</sup> = 67%) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-1.01; two studies, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), respectively. Data on mortality for ESKD patients on a DASH diet were limited to one study with an OR of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89-1.12). The pooled OR of cardiovascular mortality among ESKD patients who adhered to a plant-based diet was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68-1.08; two studies, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), compared to those who did not. Data on cardiovascular mortality among those with Mediterranean and DASH diet were limited to one study with ORs of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.90-1.43) and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.99-1.43), respectively. Mediterranean diet adherence was found to be associated with reduced risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with an OR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68-0.99) in a study including 127 ESKD patients. The risk of hyperkalemia was not significant among those with a plant-based diet with an OR of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.94-1.07) in a study including 150 ESKD patients. CONCLUSIONS: While our systematic review demonstrated no significant associations of Mediterranean, DASH, and plant-based diets with reduced all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality, there was also no evidence that suggested harmful effects of these diets to ESKD patients."

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the association between different plant-based diet indices and measures of abdominal fat distribution and liver fat content. METHODS: In a population-based sample of 578 individuals from Northern Germany (57% male, median age 62 y), diet was assessed with a validated FFQ and an overall, a healthy, and an unhealthy plant-based diet index were derived. Participants underwent MRI to assess volumes of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and liver signal intensity (LSI), a measure of liver fat content. Fatty liver disease (FLD) was defined as log LSI ≥3.0. Cross-sectional associations of the plant-based diet indices with visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat volumes, LSI, and FLD were assessed in linear and logistic regression analyses. The most comprehensive model adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, energy intake, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and BMI. RESULTS: Higher overall and healthy plant-based diet indices both revealed statistically significant associations with lower visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volumes and with lower odds of FLD in multivariable-adjusted models without BMI. Upon additional adjustment for BMI, only the association of the healthy plant-based diet with visceral adipose tissue remained statistically significant (per 10-point higher healthy plant-based diet index, percentage change in visceral adipose tissue: -4.9%, 95% CI: -8.6%, -2.0%). None of the plant-based diet indices was associated with LSI. The unhealthy plant-based diet index was unrelated to any of the abdominal or liver fat parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to healthy plant-based diets was associated with lower visceral adipose tissue. None of the other examined associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for BMI."

Major contributions relied on the relevant changes in the food pattern attained by the behavioural intervention and their robust effect in reducing hard clinical end-points. Given some potential concerns, which were appropriately addressed with supporting analyses, this review is timely and relevant. RECENT FINDINGS: PREDIMED has continued contributing to the existing literature with extensive, robust and abundant new evidence on the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, particularly on cardiovascular health, including recent studies using high-throughput metabolomic techniques. After robustly addressing some controversies, the conclusions of the original trial remained unaltered. SUMMARY: The Mediterranean diet represents an effective and robust nutritional strategy against CVD in high cardiovascular risk populations. Recent findings from the PREDIMED have identified a metabolic signature of the Mediterranean diet that can objectively determine dietary adherence and predict CVD risk. This metabolomic signature opens up a new era for nutritional epidemiology and personalized nutrition."

Limiting dietary amino acids is suggested to influence their serum levels. Further, a plant-based diet is reported to contain fewer amino acids than an animal-based diet. The extent to which a plant-based diet lowers the serum levels of amino acids in patients with cancer is unclear. METHODS: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (n=17) were enrolled in a clinical trial with an ad libitum whole food, plant-based diet for 8 weeks without calorie or portion restriction. Dietary changes by participants were monitored using a three-day food record. Serum was collected from participants at baseline and 8 weeks. Food records and serum were analyzed for metabolic changes. RESULTS: We found that a whole food, plant-based diet resulted in a lower intake of calories, fat, and amino acids and higher levels of fiber. Additionally, body weight, serum insulin, and IGF were reduced in participants. The diet contained lower levels of essential and non-essential amino acids, except for arginine (glutamine and asparagine were not measured). Importantly, the lowered dietary intake of amino acids translated to reduced serum levels of amino acids in participants (5/9 essential amino acids; 4/11 non-essential amino acids). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a tractable approach to limiting amino acid levels in persons with cancer. This data lays a foundation for studying the relationship between amino acids in patients and tumor progression. Further, a whole-food, plant-based diet has the potential to synergize with cancer therapies that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between plant-based diet indices and BMD in postmenopausal women with osteopenia/osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research was a case-control study conducted on 131 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis/osteopenia and 131 healthy women. The BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae was measured by the Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXEA) method. Participants were asked to complete a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We used three versions of plant-based diet indices, including plant-based diet index (PDI), healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI). Two different multivariable logistic regression was used for the crude and adjusted model to assess the relationship between PDI, hPDI, and uPDI with odds of femoral and lumbar BMD. RESULTS: There was a reverse association between last tertile of hPDI with femoral BMD abnormality in the both adjusted model [Model 1: odds ratio (OR): 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.63 and Model 2: OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.15-0.58, respectively]. Furthermore, we found a reverse relationship between hPDI with lumbar BMD abnormality in the first adjusted model (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.19-0.67). On the other hand, a negative association was observed in the second and last tertile of hPDI with lumbar BMD abnormality (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24-0.90 and OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17-0.64, respectively). According to the results, the association of femoral BMD abnormality in the last tertile of uPDI compared to the first tertile in the both adjusted models (Model 1: OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.52-5.36 and Model 2: OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.37-5.06) were significant. Also, we observed a positive relationship between the last tertile of uPDI with lumbar BMD abnormality compared to the lowest tertile in the both adjusted models (Model 1; OR: 4.16; 95% CI: 2.20-7.85, Model 2; OR: 4.23; 95% CI: 2.19-8.19). CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings indicated that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, a healthy plant-based diet could prevent bone loss, and an unhealthy plant-based diet might have detrimental effects on BMD."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: World-wide the prevalence of obesity is high, and promoting a shift toward more healthful and more plant-based dietary patterns appears to be one promising strategy to address this issue. A dietary score to assess adherence to a healthy plant-based diet is the healthful plant-based diet index. While there is evidence from cohort studies that an increased healthful plant-based diet index is associated with improved risk markers, evidence from intervention studies is still lacking. METHODS: A lifestyle intervention was conducted with mostly middle-aged and elderly participants from the general population (<i>n</i> = 115). The intervention consisted of a 16-month lifestyle program focusing on a healthy plant-based diet, physical activity, stress management, and community support. RESULTS: After 10 weeks, significant improvements were seen in dietary quality, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, total cholesterol, measured and calculated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, oxidized LDL particles, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and pulse pressure. After 16 months, significant decreases were seen in body weight (-1.8 kg), body mass index (-0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and measured LDL cholesterol (-12 mg/dl). Increases in the healthful plant-based diet index were associated with risk marker improvements. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation of moving toward a plant-based diet appears acceptable and actionable and may improve body weight. The healthful plant-based diet index can be a useful parameter for intervention studies."

            "abstract": "A plant-based diet is more sustainable, and research suggests that adolescents obtain health benefits from adopting a more plant-based diet (e.g., improved weight control, increased cardiovascular health). However, it is still unclear what factors promote/hinder their intention to attain such a dietary habit. The aim of the present study was to examine factors affecting adolescents' willingness to consume more plant-based foods. In a theory-based interview study, using the Reasoned Action Approach as framework, adolescents were interviewed concerning their reasons for their (un)willingness to adopt a more plant-based diet. A total of 11 adolescents (15/16 years old; 7 girls, 4 boys) were recruited and interviewed at two secondary schools in the Dutch Province of Limburg, the Netherlands. None of the interviewees reported being vegan/vegetarian/flexitarian. The interviewed adolescents overall expressed little interest in adopting a more plant-based diet. They appeared to have little knowledge of what would comprise a more plant-based diet and showed a lack of awareness of the benefits for personal and planet health. Further, most participants indicated lacking skills to prepare plant-based meals. Despite that, they felt confident they would be able to consume a much more plant-based diet for a definite period. Most importantly, the low intention to consume more plant-based food options was explained by the perceived (or expected) poor taste of these foods. We conclude that education on the plant-based diet (i.e., increasing awareness of the benefits, and skills to procure or prepare a plant-based meal) might increase both knowledge and plant-based food familiarity. The latter being important as food familiarity is key in promoting its acceptance."

Interviews were conducted with nine young adults in Sweden and the answers were analysed guided by a psychological method from descriptive phenomenology. The results indicate that the transition to a plant-based diet is a process comprising five dimensions: 1) Exploring new ways of living based on health anxieties, 2) regulating conflicting emotions through differentiation, 3) transforming traditional models into new alternatives, 4) confirming new skills and abilities and 5) integrating experiences and emotions into a whole. These five dimensions reflect how transition to a plant-based diet is experienced physically and emotionally. The results also indicate that plant-based meals and ingredients used in the new diet are loaded with symbols and conflicting emotions. Psychoanalytically informed theory, especially object relation theory, was used in discussing what can happen to the mind during the transition. In a wider perspective, this study provides insights into how a dietary transition can bring stability to the life of young adults and help them endure and master their situation. More research is needed to assess the role of mental health in transitioning to a plant-based diet and to draw more general conclusions, an area where psychodynamic theory can provide insights."

METHODS: We assessed 18,259 Spanish university graduates at baseline who participated in the SUN cohort using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Inadequate intake of Zn, I, Se, Fe, Ca, P, Mg, Cr, K, vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, C, A, D, E, and folic acid was evaluated using the estimated average requirement (EAR) cut-point approach and the probabilistic approach. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the probability of failing to meet EAR for either ≥ 3 or ≥ 6 micronutrients. RESULTS: Participants with higher adherence to the Planetary Health Diet had a lower risk of overall inadequacy, while the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) showed even greater nutritional adequacy. The adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) for failing to meet ≥ 3 EAR was 0·24 (95% CI 0·21 - 0·27) for the Planetary Health Diet Index, whereas it was substantially lower for MEDAS with OR = 0·12, 95% CI 0·11 - 0·13, and for MDS with OR = 0·09, 95% CI 0·08 - 0·10, always for the comparison of the fourth v. first quartile and using the probabilistic approach method. CONCLUSION: In this Mediterranean cohort, better adherence to both the Planetary Health Diet and the MedDiet (with a stronger inverse association) showed lower risk of micronutrient inadequacy."

Additionally, inflammatory immune responses and severe acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, including pulmonary oedema, shortness of breath, fever and nasopharyngeal infections, are associated with Na toxicity from excessive dietary Na. High dietary Na is also associated with increased risks of diseases and conditions that are co-morbid with COVID-19, including chronic kidney disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes and obesity. This article presents evidence that low dietary Na potentially mediates the association of plant-based diets with COVID-19 prevention. Processed meats and poultry injected with sodium chloride contribute considerable amounts of dietary Na in the Western diet, and the avoidance or reduction of these and other processed foods in whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diets could help lower overall dietary Na intake. Moreover, high amounts of K in plant-based diets increase urinary Na excretion, and preagricultural diets high in plant-based foods were estimated to contain much lower ratios of dietary Na to K compared with modern diets. Further research should investigate low Na in WFPB diets for protection against COVID-19 and co-morbid conditions."

METHODS: From the 'Salus in Apulia Study', that includes the MICOL and GreatAGE Studies, 584 participants were selected, firstly enrolled in MICOL3 (M3) and later in the GreatAGE Study (MICOL4, M4). Foods and micronutrients intake were recorded in both studies, and global cognitive function in M4, assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination. RESULTS: Plant-based foods, particularly coffee and vegetables, as well as vitamin A sources, were inversely associated to age-related cognitive impairment. Alcohol consumption showed a detrimental role on cognition, while red meat appeared to be beneficial in the present study, although its role is traditionally considered harmful for cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Our study confirmed that a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern based on agricultural products and low alcohol consumption may help to prevent/delay age-related cognitive impairment."

However, not all plant-based diets are necessarily healthful, and no previous study has evaluated the role of the quality of plant-based dietary patterns in frailty risk. Our aim was to assess the association between plant-based diet quality and risk of frailty. METHODS: Prospective cohort consisted with 82 234 women aged ≥60 years from the Nurses' Health Study, who were followed from 1990 through 2014. The dates of analysis were April 14 to June 23, 2021. Dietary data were collected every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The plant-based diet quality was assessed with two indices (range 18-90 points): (a) healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), where healthy plant foods (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vegetable oils and tea/coffee) received positive scores, while less healthy plant foods (fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, and sweets/desserts) and animal foods received reverse scores; and (b) unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) where positive scores were given to less healthy plant foods and reverse scores to healthy plant foods and animal foods. Frailty incidence was assessed every 4 years, being defined as having three or more of the following five criteria from the FRAIL scale: fatigue, low strength, reduced aerobic capacity, having ≥5 illnesses and weight loss ≥5%. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We identified 12 910 incident cases of frailty over 1 176 401 person-year follow-up. In the multivariable analysis, the hPDI was inversely associated with the risk of frailty (hazard ratio [HR] for the highest vs. lowest quintile: 0.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.81; P trend <0.001). In addition, a 10-unit increment in the hPDI was associated with a relative 15% lower risk of frailty. Conversely, a direct association was found between the uPDI and risk of frailty (HR highest vs. lowest quintile: 1.24 [1.17, 1.32], P trend <0.001). These associations were consistent for each frailty criterion, among participants with no frailty criteria at baseline, after excluding participants with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline, for alternative versions of the plant-based diet indices (PDIs), in subgroup analysis by categories of potential confounders, and in latency analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A healthful plant-based diet was associated with lower risk of frailty whereas an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with higher risk."

The aim of this Focused Review is to examine recent advances in nutritional cognitive neuroscience, with an emphasis on methods that enable discovery of nutrient biomarkers that predict healthy brain aging. We propose an integrative framework that calls for the synthesis of research in nutritional epidemiology and cognitive neuroscience, incorporating: (i) methods for the precise characterization of nutritional health based on the analysis of nutrient biomarker patterns (NBPs), along with (ii) modern indices of brain health derived from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of a high fiber (∼38 g/d) plant-based diet, consumed <i>ad libitum</i>, with or without added inulin-type fructans (ITF), on the gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with obesity. We also tested if baseline <i>Prevotella/Bacteroides</i> (P/B) ratio predicts weight loss outcomes. METHODS: This is a secondary exploratory analysis from the PREVENTOMICS study, in which 100 subjects (82 completers) aged 18-65 years with body mass index 27-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blinded treatment with a personalized or a generic plant-based diet. Changes from baseline to end-of-trial in gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), body composition, cardiometabolic health and inflammatory markers were evaluated in the whole cohort (<i>n</i> = 82), and also compared in the subgroup of subjects who were supplemented with an additional 20 g/d ITF-prebiotics (<i>n</i> = 21) or their controls (<i>n</i> = 22). RESULTS: In response to the plant-based diet, all subjects lost weight (-3.2 [95% CI -3.9, -2.5] kg) and experienced significant improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic health indices. Addition of ITF to the plant-based diet reduced microbial diversity (Shannon index) and selectively increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (<i>q</i> < 0.05). The change in the latter was significantly associated with higher values of insulin and HOMA-IR and lower HDL cholesterol. In addition, the LDL:HDL ratio and the concentrations of IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly elevated in the ITF-subgroup. There was no relationship between baseline P/B ratio and changes in body weight (<i>r</i> = -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.53). CONCLUSION: A plant-based diet consumed <i>ad libitum</i> modestly decreases body weight and has multiple health benefits in individuals with obesity. Addition of ITF-prebiotics on top this naturally fiber-rich background selectively changes gut microbiota composition and attenuates some of the realized cardiometabolic benefits.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following a plant-based diet is associated with a wide range of health benefits. The current study aimed to investigate the association between plant-based diet indices, specifically the plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) and risk of mortality in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: This cohort study included a total of 121 patients with cirrhosis, who were followed for four years. Plant-based diet indices were calculated based on a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire consisting of 168 items. The Hazard ratio (HR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional risk models. RESULTS: During 414 person-year of follow-up, 43 deaths (7 women, 36 men) were documented. After adjusting all confounders, it has been found that the PDI (HR <sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03-0.89, P trend = 0.024) and hPDI (HR <sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.02-0.61, P trend = 0.020) were inversely associated with the risk of mortality. While uPDI was directly associated with a significant increase in mortality risk (HR <sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 8.74, 95% CI = 0.33-17.14, P trend = 0.018). The 4-year survival rate among patients showed a significant relationship with all three indices. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that higher scores of PDI and hPDI can significantly reduce the risk of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, while a significant increase in mortality risk was found in those with higher uPDI. However, confirmation of these findings requires further studies."

However, there are few reports on central nervous system tumors, and data on dose-response relationships are lacking. This individual-matched case-control study included 506 cases and 506 controls. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and the unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI) were calculated using dietary information collected through a food frequency questionnaire, with higher scores indicating better adherence. We analyzed the relationship of plant-based diets with glioma. After adequate adjustment for confounders, PDI was associated with a reduced glioma risk (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.72). Conversely, uPDI was associated with an elevated glioma risk (OR = 8.04, 95% CI: 4.15-15.60). However, hPDI was not significantly associated with glioma risk (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.48-1.45). For subgroups, PDI was not significant in analyzing young age, BMI, or any pathological subtypes. The restricted cubic spline function showed a significant dose-response relationship between PDI (<i>p<sub>-nonlinearity</sub></i>< 0.0001) and uPDI (<i>p<sub>-nonlinearity</sub></i>= 0.0711) and glioma. Further analysis found that refined grains had the greatest effect on gliomas in the less healthy plant-based food group. Therefore, following a plant-based diet was linked to a lower risk of glioma, especially when consuming fewer unhealthy plant-based foods."

Nutritional epidemiology focused on nutrients has evolved towards the study of dietary patterns that consider synergistic interactions between foods and nutrients. This study aims to investigate the relationship between obesity and its treatment by healthy dietary patterns. The Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), based on plant products, whole grains and low levels of salt, sugars and red meat, have been shown to promote weight loss and reduce comorbidities associated with obesity. Although vegetarian and vegan diets are adequate options for disease management and prevention, they require planning to avoid nutritional deficiencies. In conclusion, healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, DASH and vegetarian options are effective in both the prevention and treatment of obesity, highlighting the importance of considering the synergy between foods and nutrients in the management of this health condition."

Food frequency questionnaire data were used to calculate the overall PDI, healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI). Periodontitis was defined using a half-reduced Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Periodontology case definition. Serum antibodies against 19 periodontopathogens were used to classify the population into two subgroups using hierarchical clustering. Survey-weighted multivariable logistic regressions were applied to assess the associations of PDI/hPDI/uPDI z-scores with periodontitis and hierarchical clusters after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 2841 (50.3%) participants were defined as having moderate/severe periodontitis. The overall PDI z-score was not significantly associated with the clinical and bacterial markers of periodontitis. By considering the healthiness of plant foods, we observed an inverse association between hPDI z-score and periodontitis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.925, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.860-0.995). In contrast, higher uPDI z-score (adherence to unhealthful plant foods) might increase the risk of periodontitis (OR = 1.100; 95% CI: 1.043-1.161). Regarding antibodies against periodontopathogens, the participants in cluster 2 had higher periodontal antibodies than those in cluster 1. The hPDI z-score was positively associated with cluster 2 (OR = 1.192; 95% CI: 1.112-1.278). In contrast, an inverse association between uPDI z-score and cluster 2 was found (OR = 0.834; 95% CI: 0.775-0.896). CONCLUSIONS: Plant-based diets were associated with periodontitis, depending on their quality. A healthy plant-based diet was inversely related to an increased risk of periodontitis but positively related to elevated antibody levels against periodontopathogens. For an unhealthy plant-based diet, the opposite trends were observed."

METHODS: Data on demographics, diet, and PSA levels was acquired from the NHANES database. Plant-based diet index (PDI) and healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) were calculated using food frequency questionnaires. A higher score on PDI and hPDI indicates higher consumption of plant foods or healthy plant foods, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between elevated PSA, clinical variables, demographics, and plant-based diet indices. RESULTS: A total of 1399 men were included in the final cohort. Median age of participants was 54 [46-63] years. Median PSA level was 0.9 [0.6-1.5] ng/dL, and 69 (4.9%) men had a PSA level ≥4 ng/dL. Although there was no association between elevated PSA and PDI, on multivariable analysis patients with higher consumption of healthy plant-based diet (high hPDI scores) had a decreased probability of having an elevated PSA (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24-0.95; P = .034). CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between increased consumption of a healthy plant-based diet and lower PSA levels. This finding may be incorporated into the shared-decision making process with patients to promote healthier lifestyle choices to reduce the likelihood of prostate biopsy and potential treatment-related morbidity."

A diet rich of whole grains, pulses, vegetables and fruits, limited in high-calorie foods (foods high in sugar or fat), red meat and foods high in salt, without sugary drinks and processed meat is recommended by the WCRF/AIRC experts to reduce the risk of cancer. The aim of this review was to examine whether Mediterranean Diet is protective or not against cancer risk. Three meta-analyses of cohort studies reported that a high adherence to the Mediterranean Diet significantly reduces the risk of cancer incidence and/or mortality. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean dietary pattern defined in the studies' part of the meta-analyses has qualitative and/or quantitative differences compared to the Mediterranean Diet of the early 1960s. Therefore, the protective role of the Mediterranean Diet against cancer has not definitely been established. In epidemiological studies, a universal definition of the Mediterranean Diet, possibly the traditional Mediterranean Diet of the early 1960s, could be useful to understand the role of this dietary pattern in cancer prevention."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between these plant-based diet indices (PDI, hPDI, and uPDI) and KS in a large group of Iranian adults. This cross-sectional study was carried out on 9,839 adult participants aged 35-70 years. Dietary data were collected using a validated semi-quantitative 118-item food frequency questionnaire. The scoring method suggested by Satija et al. was applied to examine the adherence to the PDIs including PDI, hPDI, and uPDI. These indices are grounded in evidence linking plant-based foods to health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The history of KS was identified based on self-reported information provided by the participants. Approximately 16.4% (n = 1638) of study participants were found to have KS. After adjustment for a wide range of confounding variables, a significant positive association was observed between PDI and KS (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.37). In the case of hPDI, we found no significant association between hPDI scores and risk of KS after adjustment for potential confounders (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.98-1.38). Non-significant association was also observed for uPDI and risk of KS in the fully adjusted model (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.95-1.35). In conclusion, findings of the present study showed that higher PDI score was positively associated with the risk of KS, whereas the hPDI and uPDI scores were not associated with the risk of KS. Further prospective studies are needed to establish causal relationships."

Altogether, the analysed studies show a protective effect of the Mediterranean Diet against cardiovascular disease but present different effects against specific conditions as cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease. These different effects might depend on the definition of Mediterranean Diet and the indexes of the adhesion to the same one used. To compare the effects of the Mediterranean Diet against cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke a univocal model of Mediterranean Diet should be established as a reference, and it might be represented by the Modern Mediterranean Diet Pyramid.

Research suggests consumption of a plant-based diet may improve the status of persons with chronic pain. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains has been shown to reduce chronic pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal conditions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the value of a plant-based diet in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional limitations. METHOD: Fourteen subjects participated in the eight-week study. Baseline evaluation included anthropometric measurements and completion of two self-reported outcome measures: Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). A registered dietitian nutritionist provided a sample menu cycle and education on a plant-based diet. Subjects utilized a phone app to log food intake and receive support from the dietitian. Post data collection included a repeat of the baseline measures and the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. The sample was small. Twenty subjects began, 14 completed. No comparison group was used. Results should be considered with caution. RESULTS: The diet intervention resulted in decreased pain and improvement in quality of life. Diet adherence by ten of fourteen subjects was 89% based on completion of food intake records and adherence to allowed foods. CONCLUSION: Consumption of a plant-based diet produced positive improvements in chronic pain and function. Interprofessional collaboration between physical therapists and registered dietitian nutritionists, along with other healthcare practitioners, can encourage and promote diet interventions that positively affect chronic pain."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A wide range of health benefits are associated with consuming a diet high in plant-based foods. Diet quality can be accurately assessed using plant-based diet indices, however there is inadequate evidence that plant-based diet indices are linked to obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), especially in Chinese cultures who have traditionally consumed plant-rich foods. METHODS: The data came from the China Nutrition and Health Survey. Overall, 11,580 adult participants were enrolled between 2004 and 2006 and followed up until 2009 or 2015 (follow-up rate: 73.4%). Dietary intake was assessed across three 24-h recalls, and two plant-based dietary indices [overall plant-based diet indice (PDI) and healthy plant-based diet indice (hPDI)] were calculated using China Food Composition Code and categorized into quintiles. The study's endpoints were overweight/obesity, hypertension, and T2D. The Hazard ratio (HR) and dose-response relationship were assessed using the Cox proportional risk model and restricted cubic splines. The areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the PDI and hPDI. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of more than 10 years, 1,270 (33.4%), 1,509 (31.6%), and 720 (11.5%) participants developed overweight / obesity, hypertension, and T2D, respectively. The higher PDI score was linked with a reduced risk of overweight/obesity [HR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55-0.93), <i>P</i>-trend <0.001], hypertension [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51-0.79), <i>P</i>-trend <0.001], and T2D [HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72-0.87), <i>P</i>-trend <0.001]. The hPDI score was inversely associated with overweight/obesity [HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62-0.98), <i>P</i>-trend = 0.02] and T2D [HR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75-0.93), <i>P</i>-trend = 0.001]. In the aged <55-year-old group, subgroup analysis indicated a significant negative association between PDI/hPDI and overweight/obesity, hypertension, and T2D. There was no significant difference in the areas under the curve of the fully adjusted obesity, hypertension, and diabetes prediction models between PDI and hPDI. CONCLUSION: The PDI and hPDI scores were very similar in application in Chinese populations, and our findings highlight that adherence to overall plant-based diet index helps to reduce the risk of T2D, obesity, and hypertension in Chinese adults who habitually consume plant-based foods, especially for those aged <55 year. Further understanding of how plant-based diet quality is associated with chronic disease will be needed in the future, which will help develop dietary strategies to prevent diabetes, hypertension, and related chronic diseases."

Contrary to these claims, I argue that a plant-based diet alone may not relieve chronic conditions, but potentially does so in combination with other lifestyle factors. With respect to the environment, I illuminate the landscape by discussing agricultural factors consistent across animal and plant farming such as energy and water. I conclude that physicians ought to recommend a diet that follows the science; such a diet as I have claimed is exclusionary: it excludes processed foods, especially added sugars. Lifestylfe factors also deserve to be discussed in the medical encounter as their incorporation may lead to even better health outcomes."

However, it is still unclear whether such benefits are due to its favorable effects on adiposity-associated biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between biomarkers and 3 plant-based diet indices: an overall plant-based diet index (PDI); a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI); and an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). METHODS: In the Nurses' Health Study II, 831 women [baseline mean age: 45 y; body mass index (BMI, kg/m2): 24.6] were randomly selected from those who provided 2 blood samples in 1996-1999 and 2010-2011 to measure plasma concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), insulin, retinol-binding protein-4, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Plant-based diet indices were derived from semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires assessed at each blood collection. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate cross-sectional associations, and general linear models were used to evaluate longitudinal associations. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses with multivariable adjustment including BMI, higher hPDI was associated with lower concentrations of leptin, insulin, and hsCRP, and higher adiponectin and sOB-R concentrations (biomarker differences per 10-point higher hPDI: -7.2%, -10.0%, -13.6%, 3.0%, and 1.9%, respectively; P ≤ 0.025). A higher uPDI was associated with higher concentrations of leptin and insulin (4.4% and 4.8%, respectively; P ≤ 0.048). In longitudinal analyses with multivariable adjustment including weight change, an increase in hPDI (improved plant-based diet quality) was inversely associated with changes in leptin and hsCRP (biomarker changes per 10-point hPDI increase: -7.7% and -17.8%, respectively; P ≤ 0.005), whereas an increase in uPDI (worsened plant-based diet quality) was positively associated with changes in leptin, hsCRP, and IL-6 (10.1%, 13.5%, and 12.4%, respectively; P ≤ 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a healthful plant-based diet is associated with favorable long-term changes in adiposity-associated biomarker concentrations in women."

METHODS: We collected de-identified information from the NHANES database on demographics, comorbidities, diet, and erectile dysfunction (ED). Exclusion criteria were age <20 or >70 years, incomplete plant-based diet index information, history of prostate cancer, or other missing information. Using the food frequency questionnaire, an overall plant-based diet index (PDI) and healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) were developed. A higher score on the PDI and hPDI is indicative of greater consumption of plant-based foods. RESULTS: A total of 2549 men were analyzed, of those 1085 (42.6%) have good erectile function and 1464 (57.4%) have some degree of ED [usually have erections 521 (20.4%), sometimes have erection 690 (27.1%), or never have erections 253 (9.9%)]. The median age and BMI were 54 [41-64] years and 28.8 [25.5-32.6] kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The median PDI and hPDI were 50 [46-54] and 50 [45-56], respectively. In multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis, hPDI was negatively associated with ED (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-0.99; P = .001). There was no association between PDI and ED. CONCLUSION: In a well characterized national database, we showed that a healthful plant-based diet is associated with less chance of having erectile dysfunction. Whether interventions with a plant-based diet will improve erectile function remains to be studied."

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder in the Western world. Between the years 2010 and 2019, the global prevalence of AF rose from 33.5 million to 59 million, highlighting the importance of developing equitable treatments for patients. The disease is associated with symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, AF increases the risk of developing a stroke and heart failure. Despite new insights into risk factors that can lead to the development of AF, the success of current treatments is suboptimal. Numerous risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, have been associated with the development and progression of AF. As these can be lifestyle-related risk factors, lifestyle modification may be a solution to reduce AF-related symptoms as well as episodes. Research results show that certain dietary changes can reduce AF and numerous risk factors for AF. Increasing attention is being given to Mediterranean and whole, plant-based eating patterns, which emphasize eating grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, while excluding most-or all-animal products. Hence, what are the beneficial aspects of a Mediterranean and plant-based diet which consists mainly of unprocessed foods? In the current review, we discuss the outcomes of diet-based treatments. Moreover, other diet-related treatments, brought up by patient initiatives, are highlighted. These patient-initiated studies include L-glutamine and electrolytes as options to manage AF. Also, we highlight the emerging importance of valuing patient needs and a quality-of-life-centered approach to medicine. As indicated by recent studies and patient experiences, citizen science can create inclusive solutions that lead to patient empowerment and a holistic approach for AF management."

The fatty changes in the liver are often the beginning of sequelae of complications, potentially causing steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Mediterranean diet is not only a way of eating but is considered a lifestyle and primarily consists of a plant-based diet, with olive oil as the primary lipid. In this study, we reviewed the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet on NAFLD and its efficacy in disease management. This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) 2009 guidelines. The PubMed database was used to gather articles, using the following terms individually and in combination, \"Mediterranean diet,\" \"non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,\" \"insulin resistance,\" \"metabolic syndrome,\" \"omega-3-fatty acids.\" A quality appraisal was completed to include 14 articles in this systematic review. The studies discuss the correlation between the Mediterranean diet and its role in preventing and treating NAFLD. Olive oil is the major monounsaturated fatty acid, whereas nuts, seeds, and fish consist largely of polyunsaturated fatty acids, both of which are essential components of the Mediterranean diet. The plant-based diet, having sufficient amounts of vegetables, legumes, and fruits, provides its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, playing a fundamental role in preventing oxidative stress damage. Olive oil polyphenols increase apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also decrease proliferation and angiogenesis, all of which prevent neoplasia. Adapting the Mediterranean lifestyle has shown promising effects in NAFLD, reducing overall mortality and morbidity."

            "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies have shown the beneficial effects of a largely plant-based diet, and the strong association between the consumption of a Mediterranean-type diet with healthy aging including a lower risk of cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of olive oil, fruits and vegetables and is rich in dietary fiber and polyphenols - both of which have been postulated to act as important mediators of these benefits. Polyphenols are large molecules produced by plants to protect them from environmental threats and injury. When ingested by humans, as little as 5% of these molecules are absorbed in the small intestine with the majority metabolized by the gut microbiota into absorbable simple phenolic compounds. Flavan-3-ols, a type of flavonoid, contained in grapes, berries, pome fruits, tea, and cocoa have been associated with many beneficial effects on several risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cognitive function and brain regions involved in memory formation. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that these brain and heart benefits can be attributed to endothelial vascular effects and anti-inflammatory properties among others. More recently the gut microbiota has emerged as a potential modulator of the aging brain and intriguingly polyphenols have been shown to alter microbiota composition and be metabolized by different microbial species. However, there is a need for well controlled studies in large populations to identify predictors of response, particularly given the vast inter-individual variation of human gut microbiota."

We prospectively investigated this relationship in a population-based study, and evaluated if risk varied by different types of plant-based diets. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Analyses were conducted in a sample of 14,686 middle-aged adults enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Diets were characterized using four plant-based diet indices. In the overall plant-based diet index, all plant foods were positively scored; in the healthy plant-based diet index, only healthful plant foods were positively scored; in the provegetarian diet, selected plant foods were positively scored. In the less healthy plant-based diet index, only less healthful plant foods were positively scored. All indices negatively scored animal foods. We used Cox proportional hazards models to study the association with incident CKD and linear mixed models to examine decline in eGFR, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24 years, 4343 incident CKD cases occurred. Higher adherence to a healthy plant-based diet (HR comparing quintile 5 versus quintile 1 [HR<sub>Q5 versus Q1</sub>], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.78 to 0.96; <i>P</i> for trend =0.001) and a provegetarian diet (HR<sub>Q5 versus Q1</sub>, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; <i>P</i> for trend =0.03) were associated with a lower risk of CKD, whereas higher adherence to a less healthy plant-based diet (HR<sub>Q5 versus Q1</sub>, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.21; <i>P</i> for trend =0.04) was associated with an elevated risk. Higher adherence to an overall plant-based diet and a healthy plant-based diet was associated with slower eGFR decline. The proportion of CKD attributable to lower adherence to healthy plant-based diets was 4.1% (95% CI, 0.6% to 8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to healthy plant-based diets and a vegetarian diet was associated with favorable kidney disease outcomes."

            "abstract": "A Mediterranean diet and intentional weight loss each positively affect cognitive functioning. Combining both could produce synergistic effects on cognition. The purpose of this study is to compare a Mediterranean diet lifestyle intervention with and without caloric restriction versus control on cognition, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic disease. In a three-arm trial conducted between 2017 and 2020 in Chicago, one hundred and eight-five, 55-85-year-old, predominately non-Hispanic black females with obesity were randomized (2:2:1) to an 8-month Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction intervention, Mediterranean diet alone, or control. The primary outcome was change from baseline to post-intervention in cognitive composite scores: attention, information & processing; executive function; and learning, memory, & recognition. Secondary outcomes were weight, lifestyle and cardiometabolic markers. The 8-month Mediterranean diet interventions did not significantly affect cognition. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet improved more in the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm (mean [SE] score change, +6.3 [0.7] points) and Mediterranean diet alone arm (+4.8 [0.7] points) relative to controls (+0.6 [0.9] points). Mean weight loss was greater among the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm (-4.6 [0.6] kg) compared to the Mediterranean diet alone (-2.6 [0.6] kg) and control arms (-0.6 [0.7] kg). The interventions did not affect activity or cardiometabolic risk markers; although, fasting insulin did decline in the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm relative to the Mediterranean diet alone and control arms. A Mediterranean diet lifestyle intervention with and without caloric restriction did not significantly affect cognitive function compared to controls. The Mediterranean diet interventions, however, significantly affected diet quality and body weight."
